This post presents where I plan to go next with my inquiry project.

### LIDAR

I haven't had the time to invest heavily in learning ArcGIS to interpret real global positioning data. I really want to try to predict the locations of old trees using LIDAR. The data itself looks really cool on heatmaps. I think this prceedure would be most effective in the context of a larger contiguous forest with some more substantial topography. The problem with this project on the Saanich peninsula is that it is very flat and rocky. Most of the trees here are Douglas Firs which all grow to around the same height and Arbutuses cant be seen underneath the foliage from the air. I think this would be especially effective in the context of Gambier island where I'm from.

### Indigenous Knowledge

The other perspective I want to integrate into this project is indigenous knowledge. There is an established protocol for accessing indigenous knowledge which does take time and I believe is outside the scope of this course. I will however be inversting time to contact local nations to learn more about the history of land management in different areas. This will likely require some knowlege of technology in the context of education, since meeting with individuals from the nation will likely require an online presentation. I would want to carefully prepare a slide-deck for such a presentation and would use some of the graphics and animating skills we learned during the PowerPoint lesson.

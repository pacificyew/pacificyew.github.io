This post investigates some of the applications of google Earth with one contextualization in the field of Forestry. Google as a company has ethical issues, but is useful as a starting point in many investigations.


### Deforestation in BC

We trust our government to certify registered professional foresters to practice sustainable forestry. Its generally accepted that BC is a very green province that won't run into a shortage of lumber any time soon. The first resource I would draw the attention of anyone accepting these two fallacies to it Google Earth. Recent satellite imagery of the surface of our planet provides irrefutable evidence of not only deforestation, but massive land alterations in our province.

### Google Earth

Google Earth is a very powerful proprietary tool that can be used to conduct GIS investigations. The data used is not open source, and neither are the programs that allow it to work. All google tools are heavily surveilled by both aggressive data collection routines and analytics databases. However, as it can be seen in this blog, maps integration can be a useful tool when open-source and analytics free methods are too time consuming to employ. Google maps or more ethical alternatives have their place in classrooms because they give a current view of the earth, is quite customizable, and yields lots of data for inquiry. It serves as a good jumping-off point for many GIS-related projects.


##### The BC interior
The map below shows the BC interior. Most of it at least. As you can see, the clearcuts are not only visible from space but dominate the profile of the visible landscape.

Additionally, each of these cuts, although small from a distance, are quite large upon inspection. The maximum allowable size of a small-scale community woodlot in the BC interior is 400 hectares, but as you can see, large companies are exempt from this rule.

##### The BC coast

The map below shows the BC coast. Specifically, the West Coast of Vancouver Island.

The maximum allowable size of a small-scale community woodlot in the BC interior is 200 hectares. Again here, large companies have the right to level enormous areas within designated "Tree-Farm Licenses".

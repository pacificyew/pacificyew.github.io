This is my first official post on this blog. I have created it as part of the EDCI 336 class at UVic. 

#### Hello World

I have constructed this website from a template I found on [Github](https://github.com/forever-jekyll/forever-jekyll) using Jekyll. I don't take credit for writing a lot of the skeleton of the website, but I'll credit the actual authors and software developpers in the footers once I finish the skeleton.


#### About Me

I love trees, photography, physics and education. I believe this blog will be a good place to share these interests as well as complete the objectives for my EDCI 336 class.

I have opted to not use Wordpress as the platform for this project because I dont know how they handle data. I also don't want to have to pay for my website. I hopefully will be able to use this site to host my CV, research, and cool projects in the future, so I wanted to really put the time into making something that I can own and completely control for the rest of my life.

I will be sharing quite a bit of my photography. I put a lot of thought into my pictures, and they're a good demonstration of how art and science are two sides of the same coin.

Most of my photos relate to the natural world. Growing up in British Columbia, its difficult not to be connected to our enormous forests. I'm also really interested in climate science and modelling. Hopefully this will be a platform where I can share some ameteur studies that I've been planning to do for a few years.

Anyway, I'll beat out the last few bugs on this website and hopefully it'll be all smooth sailing from there.

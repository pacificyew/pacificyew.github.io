Drawing on funds of knowledge, and integrating understandings from our course, 
readings and BC Curriculum, you will create a critically-informed reflection (as either

for your subject area. Answer, “What does it mean to be literate in my subject area?” 
Think of what students are asked to know and do, and what forms of communication

Do a deeper dive into a particular section of the curriculum in which you identify a Big 
Idea, key competencies and content.
4.
Section Three – Provide a working definition of Multiliteracies Pedagogy from our class 
discussions and readings. Discuss how a Multiliteracies Pedagogy supports/challenges 
your notions of teaching, learning and the curriculum in your subject area.
5.

learn more about during the course.

between the sections as paragraphs, or separate them out with headings. 
Stylistically, you should use first person and follow the APA guide for any direct quotations from
external sources (such as the two articles). Personal voice is encouraged here.

An outline of the PSII inquiry steps applied in a walk through a local park.

### The PSII Inquiry Steps

The Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry has determined [steps for competency assessment](https://learningstorm.org/inquiry-tools/). These steps are presented graphically below.

1. **Starting**: Learner creates/co-creates a question or questions that are of a kind that will allow an inquiry or a quest to take place.

2. **Deepening**: Learner takes on early research based on starting questions. May discuss with teacher and/or other learners to help flesh out ideas. Research may involve creating something or doing something besides just reading or talking. The goal is to improve the quality of the question(s) from Step 1.

3. **Refining**: Learner creates new questions based on research and learning in Step 2. These could be expressed in a mind map (to show how learner got there), or just a new list of questions.

4. **Planning**: Learner develops and plans learning activities, projects, sessions, experiences, etc. to address/explore new questions from Step 3, including timelines, assessment ideas, and resource needs.

5. **Learning**: Learner follows plans from Step 4, making modifications as needed. Daily and weekly work plans will reflect short-term goals. Assessment of learning will take place throughout this step. Reflection on learning is also part of this step.


### Inquiry Steps Applied to Tree Project

1. **Starting**: I begin with the questions: "What is the biggest tree in Konuckson park?", and "How will I find it?"

2. **Deepening**: I can increase my knowledge of Konuckson Park by contacting knowledge holders or finding resources regarding the history of the park. I can learn about the trees from literature. I can use GIS to hint at probable locations of trees. 

3. **Refining**: After some research, I now wonder: "What is the history of Konuckson Park?", "Was the area ever cleared or human-managed?", "How would this affect the history of the trees?", "Where is the most probable location of a large tree?"

4. **Planning**: I then commit to physically exploring the partsof Konuckson park which I think would be the most likely to have large trees. Since it was a wet area, I suspect to be looking for large Cottonwoods or Cedars. The timeline and notes are recorded in this blog. 

5. **Learning**: After extensive searching, large trees were found. I now wonder if my research and explorations were exhaustive enough to merit moving on to a new area. I decide, my search was indeed exhaustive and continue to researching a new area (Phyllis Park). I can take what I learned from this cycle of the inquiry steps forward into future planning.

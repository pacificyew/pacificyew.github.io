This post summarizes the results of scanning the queens park area for big trees.


### Measurement Details

My friend Jaden and I set out to measure the height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of the trees of Queens park. It should be said that it was dark out, but the light of the moon made it easy enough to see the top branches of the trees thus facilitating the use of our sextant. We took the average of many meausrements from a few angles around the trees. 

### We Found Big Trees!

Its surprising to me how big the trees in the park really are. I effectively grew up in the park and never really gave the trees a second glance, but with an eye for it now, I can say the trees are defenitely something to behold. Many of them likely are older than the city and would in my mind qualify as old-growth. Assuming a growth rate of 3 mm every year for cedars (considering the areas is quite wet), some of the trees may exceed 300 years of age. The locations and measurements are shown below:

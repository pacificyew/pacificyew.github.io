This post is a reflection regarding accessible learning and the presentation from BCEdAccess.

### Phones in the classroom

The main reflection I had about this presentation is how useful technology can be in the context of accessible education and students with exceptionalities. This topic ties in both with an inquiry project I'm conducting at Esquimalt, as well as the group project I am working on in this class.

At Esquimalt, I'm investigating assessment methods and how they can be discriminatory. One topic that has come out of that discussion is the role that phones play in classrooms. It is clear that some students are aided greatly if not are dependant on accessible learning software on their devices. Despite this, many teachers prohibit the use of phones or other technologies in their classrooms. This is very clearly a disriminatory practice, and was touched on by our speaker during the question period.

For my group project, I am researching protocols with how to get students to break their addiction to social media in the class and put down their phones. The scope of this project are the psychological and cultural effects of social media in general.

### Should We Take Phones?

Many teachers take phones from students in their classess. In spite of the examples of where phones can be useful mentioned earlier, I do think there is a place for teachers to discourage over-use of phones. Digging deeper into the group assignment of this course had us all critiquing and reflecting on the film 'The Social Dilemna'. The film doesn't mention anything groundbreaking that people don't already generally know, but it does a good job bringing all the effects of social media into one place (except the positive ones). Younger students are overwhelmingly addicted to social media, and I think its fair for them to be aksed to take a break for the short duration of classes. Taking phones should always be handled on a case-by-case basis since students may depend on their phones for reasons other than social media.

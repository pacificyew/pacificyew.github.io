A rough summary of project procedure and preliminary knowledge about local trees.

### Tree Search Details

The word "discovery" has been applied to many advancements by settlers in BC through history. To be clear, this is a personal project intended to collect and compile resources regarding interesting trees on the Saanich peninsula. I've only lived in this region for a few months, and I believe this project is a good excuse to learn about the region. 

Before a comprehensive search for cool trees around Victoria begins, I have to specify some details about the search.

- What is the relevance of this project?
- How do we define a "big", "old", "gnarly" or otherwise "interesting" tree?
- What measurements should be performed on trees found?
- Which areas will be searched?

### What is the Point?

Through this project, I hope to develop a catalogue of "big", "old", "gnarly" or otherwise "interesting" trees. This catalogue will contain:

- Exact tree locations (Lat., Long.)
- Identify each tree' species 
- Reference to species-specific entry in "Trees of BC" section of this blog
- Average dimensions (circumference, height)
- Pictures

Honestly, this officially does nothing more than satisfy a personal curiosity, since all of this information has already been compiled by the municipalities of the region, even if it is not public.

### Which trees should be included in Search?

Walking down the street or through a park, there are trees everywhere. In order to make this project more concrete, I need operational definitions of "big", "old", or "gnarly". Any combination of these adjectives constitues an "interesting" tree. 

##### Trees of BC

Firstly, I want to restrict this project mostly to trees native to BC. This excludes many large trees in residential areas despite their size, but simplifies the project dramatically. I have included a list and summaries of the species I will be investigating under the tab "Trees of BC". I hope to eventually compile a well-rounded list of resources to populate the entry for each species in that section. I will start by quoting the popular "Plants of Coastal British Columbia"[^2]

By species, this project will investigate:

- Western Hemlock
- Grand Fir
- Douglas Fir
- Sitka Spruce
- Pines (Lodgepole, Ponderosa, Jeffrey, Monterey)
- Pacific Yew
- Red Cedar
- Yellow Cedar
- Red Alder
- Bigleaf Maple
- Black Cottonwood
- Giant Sequoia
- Redwood Sequoia
- Arbutus
- Garry Oak
- Dogwood


##### "Big" Trees

A big tree will be visually distinct with respect to other trees either in height or width. For conifers, I will set the "width" threshold for consideration in my index to be "easily more than my wingspan in diameter" which is approximately 175 cm. If a tree is found that roughly meets this criteria, its circumference will be measured by tape. For simplicity, I will just add every tree that I go to the trouble of measuring. To measure height, a sextant will be used. This is a device that measures angle. By measuring the angle between the horizontal and the top of the tree and recording some distances, you can roughly determine the tree height. 

Its harder to set a standard working definition of "big" for deciduous trees. I'm mostly going to focus on conifers anyway, but will visit most of the municipally recorded "significant" trees close to my location.

##### "Old" Trees

An Old tree is defined as a tree that germinated before settlers would have logged an area. Note that traditional land management could account for the clearing of land. For the sake of this project, I'll set the "old" threshold to be 250 years old - the way old growth is defined by the government. It is hard to determine the age of a tree. You need an increment bore to do it accurately. Some day I mmight buy one, but for the sake of this project, I will infer tree age from their diameter and the growth rates of trees of the same species. A felled tree can be measured for their average growth rate. I will therefore have to keep eyes out for dead trees with discernable ring structures to get a good estimate of the average growth rates for species in an area.

##### "Gnarly" Trees

A **Gnarly** tree is one that looks lit like these californian Bristlecone Pines.

### Where are the trees?

To be clear, very comprehensive lists of "significant" trees have already been compiled in the municipalities of Victoria and Saanich. Since these are the regions closest to me, it is here that I will search for cool trees. For the sake of completeness, I will compile these municipal resources here. Through Saanich's [significant tree program,](https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/natural-environment/trees/significant-tree-program.html) we have a valuable list of [Schedule "B" to tree preservation bylaw, 2014 No. 9272.](https://www.saanich.ca/assets/Community/Documents/ScheduleB-Significant-Trees.pdf) This list gives accurate directions to these trees as well as descriptions, and rough dimensions. They do not incrude their exact Lat. and Long. coordinates or accurate measurements. It is a rough list of some 150 trees of significance in the Saanich area. This resource is a valuable starting point for this project.

The Victoria municipality takes this one step further providing an [entire LIDAR profile](https://opendata.victoria.ca) of the city' tree canopy. An example is shown to the right. Vast data sets regarding the trees within this district are hosted through VicMap.[^1] When I get to looking at the Victoria district, I will try to use this LIDAR data. I should be able to search by specific height to find trees higher than a given threshold. This may be more trouble than it is worth.

The Highlands municipality has their [Green Map](https://www.highlands.ca/187/Maps) also detailing rough locations of interesting flora. I don't know if I will be able to travel over there however.

The [BC big tree registry](https://bigtrees.forestry.ubc.ca/bc-bigtree-registry/) lists the largest known trees in BC. A couple of which are on the Saanich peninsula. This list will be consulted when exploring outside of the GVA. A snapshot of the list is shown here. Other than these resources, I hope to consult with traditional knowledge holders and experts, the raw LIDAR data, and directed hiking to find other trees to add to this list.

### Summary of Significant Trees

This table is a summary of the known trees than I'd like to visit. It is compiled from open datasets provided from local municipalities as well as the UBC big tree registry. I know for fact that this list is not exhaustive and have personally found trees not mentioned on this list of comparable and in some cases larger size.

<p>This blog is an electronic journal that I use to post my photography, research, teaching material, and writing. I am sensitive to the way my data is stored by less-than-savoury corporations, but also want some sovereignty over the way I express myself online. For these reasons, I have tailored this website to present my projects in the way I want.</p>

<h5 id="photography">Photography</h5>

<p>Iâ€™ve refrained over the years from posting my real photography on social media. Iâ€™ve felt that these platforms are inadequate for me to properly convey the meaning behind each image. Iâ€™ve waitied until I could tailor the medium to best reflect the media.</p>

<p>Everything on this website is open source and easy to access. If you like a picture, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/pacificyew/pacificyew.github.io/tree/main/assets/image">download them</a>. Iâ€™m thinking of adding them to the creative commons but havenâ€™t done it yet. If youâ€™d like to post them on social media, please place a link to this blog and the story behind the picture you are posting:</p>

<p>Above anything else, this is a journal. I dont expect many people are going to read this and thats not the point. I write entries like these posts in my journal every day. This website gives me an excuse to practice my HTML and to collect my thoughts about my shots. It also makes it easier to share pictures with people.</p>

<p>This blog began as an assigment for my EDCI course at UVic. In the post-postmodern world, the internet is the medium for a lot of learning. It is a place for people to spread ideas, and in an ideal world, it will remain an uncensored place for all perspectives to be shared. I have been using this project as a way to practice my HTML and bash navigation; two skills I believe are crucial to understanding how your computer works and how your computer acquires information from the aether.

This post is an outline of the free-inquiry project I will complete for EDCI 336.</p>

<h3 id="trees-of-victoria">Trees of Victoria</h3>

<p>I have decided to dedicate my free inquiry project to recording the size and locations of all the large or otherwise notable trees in the greater Victoria area (GVA). With help from the UBC Big Tree registry, GPS and GIS software, LIDAR (mapping technology), some basic measurement equipment, a camera and extensive hiking, I hope to reveal interesting dendrological specimens that grow around the Saanich peninsula.</p>

I love discovering weird trees, especially those in urban places. I have wanted to start this project for some time but have lacked a medium through which I could record and document my procedure and findings. I believe this assignment for EDCI 336 is the perfect excuse to get moving. This blog will provide the perfect platform to summarize my notes and procedure for exhaustively searching the entire GVA for ‚Äúcool‚Äù trees. It is also ideal for combining and presenting mixed media. As such, my notes, photos, maps and graphs can all be presented in a single post to best reflect an adventure or finding from a given day. The blog format is linear and simple which also serves as a useful educational tool.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Crazy trees can be found where you would least expect them. My friend Jaden and I once found a Douglas Fir 2m in diameter (which is bigger than it sounds) right in our neighbourhood of Queens park. We had grown up our entire lives around this tree and always known of its presence, but we had never stopped and dedicated the entirety of our though to admiring the existence of this tree.</p>

I‚Äôve never taken a biology course in my life, but as I spend more time around trees and allow their presence to just occupy my mind, the more my respect for the field deepens. Trees are amazing. Take it from me - a physicist who used to think that anything termed ‚Äúorganism‚Äù could be modelled by a spherical body of water in a vaccuum. We cannot live without them, and neither can the rest of our planet. As my appreciation for trees has grown, I have picked up on their language - small details I would never have noticed before. They make different sounds, smells and colours in different conditions, even within the same species. Fairly <a href="https://suzannesimard.com/research/">novel research</a> by my hero Susanne Simard at UBC confirms that in many ways, trees do communicate. Forester Peter Wohlleben characterizes this research best in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Life-Trees-Communicate_Discoveries-Secret/dp/1771642483/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=hidden+life+of+trees&amp;qid=1632378107&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Hidden Life of Trees.</em></a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Notably in our remaining old growth forests here in BC,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äúthe root systems of neighbouring trees inevitably intersect and grow into one another [and] usually there are fungi present that act as intermediaries to guarantee quick dissemination of ‚Ä¶ news. These fungi operate like fiber optic cables ‚Ä¶ fungal connections transmit signals from one tree to the next, helping trees exchange news about insects, drought, and other dangers. Science has adopted a term first coined by the journal <em>NATURE</em><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> for Dr. Simard‚Äôs discovery of the ‚Äòwood wide web‚Äô pervading our forests‚Äù(10)</p>

<h3 id="project-outline">Project Outline</h3>

<p>In essence, I want to systematically explore the entire GVA for interesting, gnarly, old or big trees on my mind. Obviously, it would help to have a guide of where to look for cool trees in order to expediate the search. Here I identify 3 main sources that might hint to where I will find them. This assignment is intended to focus on learning new skills; specifically those relating to tech literacy and education. I have chosen these three information systems specifically because I am not knowledgable in their use.</p>

<h5 id="consultation-with-experts-and-indigenous-knowledge-holders">Consultation with Experts and Indigenous knowledge Holders</h5>

<p>Obviously, in a search to find interesting trees it would help to get in touch with those who study interesting trees, or else people who have lived around such trees since time immemorial. Although this consultation does not rely heavily on tech literacy outside email and other electronic communications, I believe that what I learn can be presented over a technological platform such as this blog. This blog allows for many modalities of knowledge to be presented. I will therefore summarize my learning with experts through my blog posts.</p>

<h5 id="physical-exploration">Physical Exploration</h5>

<p>To find interesting trees, it will be crucial to physically search for them. Technology can be used to organize and expediate this process to avoid repeatedly searching particular places. It can be tricky to navigate the large forested parks in Victoria, so I will use the mapping features of either my phone or a dedicated GPS device to track my progress. My physical progress of sweeping the city will be summarized graphically on this blog.</p>

<h5 id="global-information-systems-gis-and-other-software">Global Information Systems (GIS) and Other Software</h5>

<p>I recently came across public light detection and ranging (LIDAR)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> data for Stanley park<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> as collected by the Vancouver Parks board. The authors of the <a href="https://vancouversbigtrees.com/stanley-park/">Vancouver Big Tree Hiking Guide</a> then inspired me to consider using LIDAR to search for interesting trees. LIDAR paints a picture of the topography of a forest. It paints a 3D profile of a birds-eye-view. By subtracting out public data about the altitude of the ground, you can produce heatmaps that reveal where the tallest trees in a forest are located. An example of this is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/StanleyParkLidar.jpg" alt="Fig. 1" /></p>

<p>I am entirely unfamiliar with the software used to produce this plot, but its usefulness in this project cannot be understated. I have therefore decided to use this assignment as an excuse to learn ArcGIS; the software responsible for processing LIDAR data. Hopefully I will be able to create dendrological treasure maps pointing to the tall trees of Victoria. ArcGIS is installed on one computer for public use in the UVic library.</p>

<h3 id="free-inquiry-project-criteria">Free-Inquiry Project Criteria</h3>

<p>Since trees and the sciences that describe them frequently occupy my mind, I believe this project adequately fits the criteria for this assignment; ‚Äúa project to learn about something you are passionate or curious about.‚Äù Since ‚Äúthe purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use technology throughout the learning process, from finding resources and people, to documenting, curating, and reflecting on your learning‚Äù, through the use of this blog, open-source GIS software and LIDAR data, MATLAB, the creative commons and other online materials, I will demonstrate this learning outcome.</p>

<h5 id="iste-student-learning-outcomes">ISTE Student Learning Outcomes</h5>

<p>This assignment is set to address points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the <a href="https://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards-for-students">ISTE learning outcomes</a>. I have them listed here for my own reflection to refer back to when writing posts and updates to this project.</p>

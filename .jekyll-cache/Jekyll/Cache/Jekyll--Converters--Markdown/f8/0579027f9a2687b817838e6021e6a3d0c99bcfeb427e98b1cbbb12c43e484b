This website is no longer in its infancy. This post outlines the process by which I created this blog.</p>

<p>I don’t really have much coding experience. Most of my data crunching was done in MATLAB in my undergrad. I had a course in Fortran, but those skills dont really translate to useful languages that are actually used today. The most useful thing i learned was navigating my computer using bash. Creating and deleting files, editing documents, and writing programs from the command line.<img src="/assets/jekyllreflection/homebrew.png" align="right" width="230px" />UNIX based computers do this with a “terminal” program, Windows computers have DOS and whatever they call their command line. This is basically where my knowledge ended before this program. Anyone who is looking at this post for advice, look elsewhere; I basically just banged my head against it for a couple months.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Homebrew is a free open-source package manager that operates from command line on UNIX-based operating systems. It was created in 2009. I used Homebrew to install jekyll and its dependancies as well as other useful software that I didnt know existed before this. Homebrew installs into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code> by default. Hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cmd + Shift + .</code> to see otherwise hidden folders in Finder. Dont delete any of them for no reason though, apple hid them for a reason. Running</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>in Terminal will install Homebrew. The <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew webiste</a> contains analytics data, programs, changelogs etc. Homebrew was necessary for installing Jekyll which is the main compiler for the website. After all the programs necessary for jekyll were installed, I haven’t really used Homebrew much.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll">Jekyll<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h3>

<p>Jekyll is a program that compiles websites. It is written in Ruby by Github founder Tom Preston-Werner. A host of volunteers maintains the software, and its most stable release was 4.2.0 in 2020. Detailed instructions for its installation are on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">their website</a>. If you are running the latest operating systems of MacOS, I think it will probably work as advertised. For the rest of us stuck in late 2015, Jekyll only works with a particular version of Ruby installed (&gt;2.5.0). Newer versions for whatever reason dont like being installed. I had issues with OpenSSH not being the right version. I don’t honestly remember what I did to get everything to install properly but forums are your friend. People with actual modern computers probably won’t have the issues I did since</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jekyll requires Ruby v2.5.0 or higher. macOS Big Sur 11.x ships with Ruby 2.6.3. Check your Ruby version using ruby -v.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mostly followed the instructions on the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/">Jekyll website</a> for the installation. Once set up, define a folder that you want to permanently be the website folder, then hit</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ jekyll name-of-new-website
$ cd name-of-new-website
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The last line here hosts the website locally and updates every time you make a change to it. You can turn off your internet and work on it remotely. To view it in your browser go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000</code>.</p>

This post is a summary of some of the discussions held during the EdTech activity this week.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>What is the purpose of pre-requisites? It is argued that many courses require students to draw upon understandings established in previous courses. Many courses including Math 10 in BC, are required to be taken by students in order to graduate. The argument within these fields is that knowledge and content is foundational, and cannot be learned in a different order.</p>

<p>In the fields of humaninites and the arts, no such hiearchy of content exists to the extent that it forces students to take some courses and restrict them from taking others. It is also worthy to note that arts and huanities courses outside of a main language stream are not required for students to graduate</p>

<h3 id="are-these-pre-requisites-necessary">Are these Pre-requisites necessary?</h3>

<p>In the context of non-STEM courses, in my experience, no process of discriminating students exists to prohibit students from graduating. Pre-requisites, as we discussed in the activity, are largely a STEM-centered concept. But are these barriers necessary? AS we saw with many of the PSII resources, inquiry-based learning is very useful in STEM. Inquiry-based learning is also by definition cross-curricular. So by pretending that fields in STEM are somehow disparate and disconnected from the others means that students lose out on learning opportunities. By imposing pre-requisites, we also stop students from reaching outside the prescribed content for each class to explore the topics.</p>

<p>Furthermore, pre-requisites prohibit students from accessing certain material which might be within the context of the content they are learning. Pre-requisites also stop many students from learning more about a topic. These facts combined with often discriminatory, unstandardized, arbitrary or weakly communicated assessment schemes usually inhibits education. Our group concluded for these reasons and more that pre-requisites are not necessary in a high-school setting.</p>

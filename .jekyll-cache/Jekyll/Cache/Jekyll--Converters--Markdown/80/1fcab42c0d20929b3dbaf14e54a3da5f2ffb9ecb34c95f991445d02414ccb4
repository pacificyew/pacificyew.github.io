I"3<p>Reflection on the use of open-source educational material online.</p>

<h3 id="favourite-open-sources-of-information">Favourite Open Sources of Information</h3>

<p>My immediate reflections about this week center around my two favourite open sources of educational material - Wikipedia and the Creative Commons. Both have pros and cons, but I will be using both in my own future work.</p>

<h5 id="wikipedia">Wikipedia</h5>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>; the free encyclopedia has a bad reputation for not being accurate. Although its true in some cases, all sources of information, including peer-reviewed journals are subject to inaccuracies once in a while. I believe the strength of wikipedia is its ability to compile useful information. In published articles that have been reviewed, most claims are cited, providing a long list of shortcuts to potentially very reputable sources. Wikipdeia is also powered by the Creative Commons, and the many forms of information embedded in articles (images, gifs, videos) compliment the acticles themselves.</p>

<h5 id="creative-commons">Creative Commons</h5>

<p>The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is a hub for open-access media. It is a public databas of content free from many copyright legislation. This database is useful in education because it can be embedded and cited freely when building your own resources. Many works can also be manipulated and adjusted and republished. I hope to eventually register some of the work on this blog in the Creative Commons.</p>

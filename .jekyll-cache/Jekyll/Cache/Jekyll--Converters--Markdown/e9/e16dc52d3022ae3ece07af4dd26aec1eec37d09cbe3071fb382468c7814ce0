This post is a reflections about my own thoughts on blended learning, in particular asynchronous online learning.</p>

<h3 id="bias-against-online-learning">Bias Against Online Learning</h3>

<p>This phrase alone prompts groans from most of my peers outside of the education programme. Perhaps this is due to having had stellar in-person lectures throughout our undergrad before COVID hit. When we were forced online and our profs at SFU scrambled to go online, the quality in education tanked immediately. Those who held lectures in person tried to maintain their exact lecture style facing a camera. Those who decided on asynchronous lectures simply recorded the most expensive YoutTube videos I hope ever to pay for. It was these qualities alone that tarnished my own perception of online learning in general, and I think it is important for me to acknowledge this bias in order to learn more about the topic.</p>

<h3 id="materials-presented-in-lecture">Materials presented in Lecture</h3>

<p>The resources and materials presented in lecture helped me understand that online learning transcends zoom, and that technology in education transcends online learning. For example, one program you touched on only briefly allowed individuals participating in conferences to collaborate on a microscopic level within a macroscopic online context. Avatars could be moved within a GUI and interact with other peers, chose which conferences they wanted to join as well as other functions.</p>

<h3 id="perks-on-online-learning">Perks on Online Learning</h3>

<p>THere are definite benfits I can see to online resources for delivering material, especially when teaching in rural communities. For students unable to make it to class, having resources handy to allow them to connect from home or view materials asynchronously is crucial. I think it should be a feature of every class just for reference studying or recalling information. The system for organizing this should be easy to access and organize in a logical way.</p>

<p>With these perks in mind, I still think that in-person methods of teaching are more effective in many cases. Physical communication and collaboration skills are attributes I value in relationships and younger people who dont have the opportunity to go to school in-person miss out on learning these skills.</p>

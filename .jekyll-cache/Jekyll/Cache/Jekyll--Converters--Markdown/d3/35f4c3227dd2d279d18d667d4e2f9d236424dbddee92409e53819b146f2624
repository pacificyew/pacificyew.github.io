A rough summary of project procedure and preliminary knowledge about local trees.</p>

<h3 id="tree-search-details">Tree Search Details</h3>

<p>The word â€œdiscoveryâ€ has been applied to many advancements by settlers in BC through history. To be clear, this is a personal project intended to collect and compile resources regarding interesting trees on the Saanich peninsula. Iâ€™ve only lived in this region for a few months, and I believe this project is a good excuse to learn about the region.</p>

<p>Before a comprehensive search for cool trees around Victoria begins, I have to specify some details about the search.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the relevance of this project?</li>
  <li>How do we define a â€œbigâ€, â€œoldâ€, â€œgnarlyâ€ or otherwise â€œinterestingâ€ tree?</li>
  <li>What measurements should be performed on trees found?</li>
  <li>Which areas will be searched?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-the-point">What is the Point?</h3>

<p>Through this project, I hope to develop a catalogue of â€œbigâ€, â€œoldâ€, â€œgnarlyâ€ or otherwise â€œinterestingâ€ trees. This catalogue will contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exact tree locations (Lat., Long.)</li>
  <li>Identify each treeâ€™ species</li>
  <li>Reference to species-specific entry in â€œTrees of BCâ€ section of this blog</li>
  <li>Average dimensions (circumference, height)</li>
  <li>Pictures</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, this officially does nothing more than satisfy a personal curiosity, since all of this information has already been compiled by the municipalities of the region, even if it is not public.</p>

<h3 id="which-trees-should-be-included-in-search">Which trees should be included in Search?</h3>

<p>Walking down the street or through a park, there are trees everywhere. In order to make this project more concrete, I need operational definitions of â€œbigâ€, â€œoldâ€, or â€œgnarlyâ€. Any combination of these adjectives constitues an â€œinterestingâ€ tree.</p>

<h5 id="trees-of-bc">Trees of BC</h5>

<p>Firstly, I want to restrict this project mostly to trees native to BC. This excludes many large trees in residential areas despite their size, but simplifies the project dramatically. I have included a list and summaries of the species I will be investigating under the tab â€œTrees of BCâ€. I hope to eventually compile a well-rounded list of resources to populate the entry for each species in that section. I will start by quoting the popular â€œPlants of Coastal British Columbiaâ€<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>By species, this project will investigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Western Hemlock</li>
  <li>Grand Fir</li>
  <li>Douglas Fir</li>
  <li>Sitka Spruce</li>
  <li>Pines (Lodgepole, Ponderosa, Jeffrey, Monterey)</li>
  <li>Pacific Yew</li>
  <li>Red Cedar</li>
  <li>Yellow Cedar</li>
  <li>Red Alder</li>
  <li>Bigleaf Maple</li>
  <li>Black Cottonwood</li>
  <li>Giant Sequoia</li>
  <li>Redwood Sequoia</li>
  <li>Arbutus</li>
  <li>Garry Oak</li>
  <li>Dogwood</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="big-trees">â€œBigâ€ Trees</h5>

<p>A big tree will be visually distinct with respect to other trees either in height or width. For conifers, I will set the â€œwidthâ€ threshold for consideration in my index to be â€œeasily more than my wingspan in diameterâ€ which is approximately 175 cm. If a tree is found that roughly meets this criteria, its circumference will be measured by tape. For simplicity, I will just add every tree that I go to the trouble of measuring. To measure height, a sextant will be used. This is a device that measures angle. By measuring the angle between the horizontal and the top of the tree and recording some distances, you can roughly determine the tree height.</p>

<p>Its harder to set a standard working definition of â€œbigâ€ for deciduous trees. Iâ€™m mostly going to focus on conifers anyway, but will visit most of the municipally recorded â€œsignificantâ€ trees close to my location.</p>

<h5 id="old-trees">â€œOldâ€ Trees</h5>

<p>An Old tree is defined as a tree that germinated before settlers would have logged an area. Note that traditional land management could account for the clearing of land. For the sake of this project, Iâ€™ll set the â€œoldâ€ threshold to be 250 years old - the way old growth is defined by the government. It is hard to determine the age of a tree. You need an increment bore to do it accurately. Some day I mmight buy one, but for the sake of this project, I will infer tree age from their diameter and the growth rates of trees of the same species. A felled tree can be measured for their average growth rate. I will therefore have to keep eyes out for dead trees with discernable ring structures to get a good estimate of the average growth rates for species in an area.</p>

<h5 id="gnarly-trees">â€œGnarlyâ€ Trees</h5>

<p>A <strong>Gnarly</strong> tree is one that looks lit like these californian Bristlecone Pines.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/bristlecone.jpg" alt="Bristlecone Pine." /></p>

<h3 id="where-are-the-trees">Where are the trees?</h3>

<p>To be clear, very comprehensive lists of â€œsignificantâ€ trees have already been compiled in the municipalities of Victoria and Saanich. Since these are the regions closest to me, it is here that I will search for cool trees. For the sake of completeness, I will compile these municipal resources here. Through Saanichâ€™s <a href="https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/natural-environment/trees/significant-tree-program.html">significant tree program,</a> we have a valuable list of <a href="https://www.saanich.ca/assets/Community/Documents/ScheduleB-Significant-Trees.pdf">Schedule â€œBâ€ to tree preservation bylaw, 2014 No. 9272.</a> This list gives accurate directions to these trees as well as descriptions, and rough dimensions. They do not incrude their exact Lat. and Long. coordinates or accurate measurements. It is a rough list of some 150 trees of significance in the Saanich area. This resource is a valuable starting point for this project.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/VicLidar1.png" alt="viclidar" />
The Victoria municipality takes this one step further providing an <a href="https://opendata.victoria.ca">entire LIDAR profile</a> of the cityâ€™ tree canopy. An example is shown to the right. Vast data sets regarding the trees within this district are hosted through VicMap.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> When I get to looking at the Victoria district, I will try to use this LIDAR data. I should be able to search by specific height to find trees higher than a given threshold. This may be more trouble than it is worth.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/UBCBigTree1.png" align="right" width="330px" />
The Highlands municipality has their <a href="https://www.highlands.ca/187/Maps">Green Map</a> also detailing rough locations of interesting flora. I donâ€™t know if I will be able to travel over there however.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bigtrees.forestry.ubc.ca/bc-bigtree-registry/">BC big tree registry</a> lists the largest known trees in BC. A couple of which are on the Saanich peninsula. This list will be consulted when exploring outside of the GVA. A snapshot of the list is shown here. Other than these resources, I hope to consult with traditional knowledge holders and experts, the raw LIDAR data, and directed hiking to find other trees to add to this list.</p>

<h3 id="summary-of-significant-trees">Summary of Significant Trees</h3>

<p>This table is a summary of the known trees than Iâ€™d like to visit. It is compiled from open datasets provided from local municipalities as well as the UBC big tree registry. I know for fact that this list is not exhaustive and have personally found trees not mentioned on this list of comparable and in some cases larger size.</p>

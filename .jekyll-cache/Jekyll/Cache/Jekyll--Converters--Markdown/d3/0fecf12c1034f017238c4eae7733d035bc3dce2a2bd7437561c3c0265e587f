<h3 id="mathcatcher">Mathcatcher</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/mathcatcher.html">Mathcatcher</a> is a math education program developped by a team of engaged professors at SFU. The motivation behind the program is to engage a wide demographic of students through indigenous storytelling. The programm does outreach and workshops at schools around Canada and has succeeded in constructing a network of math and indigenous language educators around the counrty.</p>

<h3 id="my-involvement-with-mathcatcher">My Involvement with Mathcatcher</h3>

<p>I am currently a research assistant for the Math department at SFU under Dr. Veselin Jungic. Veselin is effectively the father of the project and he is responsible for organizing pretty much everything. I am responsible for editing and directing the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/mathcatcher/StoriesMovies.html">Mathcatcher videos</a>. In particular, I have been working on the project since the beginning of this year and have produced all of the French, Spanish, a Gitxsan and a few Wet’suwet’en videos.</p>

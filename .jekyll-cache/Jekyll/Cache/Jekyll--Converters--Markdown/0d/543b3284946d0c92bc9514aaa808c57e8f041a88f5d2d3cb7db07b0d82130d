This post outlines how some of the content in the EDTech class can be integrated into my Big Tree Inquiry.</p>

<h3 id="digital-footprint">Digital Footprint</h3>

<p>It is in my own nature to not want to share my personal work and research, especially when I cant control how that information is further shared. Im torn as to what the role of this blog should be in my life, and I think I want to keep it relatviely private in the sense that I won’t be sharing it with my classes. That being said, it should be at the level that I wouldn’t be scared if the students found it. These ideas circulated during the first presentation in the class in which the speaker outlined how we should shape our digital footprints.</p>

<h3 id="communication-is-key">Communication is Key</h3>

<p>Communication is key in education. I believe that once I have published some of the information, and needless to say, once I have time to put more effort into the project, I might consider opening the blog up as a resource for inquiry projects in my own class. The methods by which I share the blog would probably refelect the techniques in this class.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I was doing a math lesson on geometry and we were investigating whether old trees or young trees put on more wood every year, I could open up a blog post on the projector as a resource to start the lesson. Google maps could be used to explore an area virtually, and the integrated maps could be used to show where local big trees are. If one was close to the school, we could even go there in person.</p>

<p>Where learning is online, the maps integration would also be helpful. Students who live in disparate parts of the province could optionally mark their position on an open public map. Hiking trips or tree explorations could be planned etc.</p>

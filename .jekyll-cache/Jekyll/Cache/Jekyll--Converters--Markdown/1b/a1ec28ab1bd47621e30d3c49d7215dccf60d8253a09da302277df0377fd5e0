This post sumarizes some of the group work that has been done on the final project for this class. The subject of our presentation is student usage of social media.

<h3 id="the-social-dilemna">The Social Dilemna</h3>

<p>This project was largely inspired by the documentary â€˜The Social Dilemnaâ€™ directed by Jeff Orlowski. We watched this documentary as reasearch for our group. The film inspired many of our subsequent discussions. In particular, I was focused on techniques of minimizing studentsâ€™ use of phones within the classroom and furthermore, whether we should.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-social-media-usage">Tracking Social Media Usage</h3>

<p>We began the exploration by tracking our own social media usage. In the fallout of watching the documentary, most of my groupmates were eager to undergo self-reflections regarding their own behaviour. I donâ€™t have social media, so I chose to adapt this activity to overall screen time on my phone to investigate exactly what it was that I do with my phone time.</p>

<p>My own usage was around 1 hour of screen time a day. Most of that time spent on the web browser on my phone. It didnâ€™t really surprise me to see that most of that time was actually used on Wikipedia. I have a habit when someone mentions something in passing that I want to know more about, I visit the wikipedia page. I find its an awesome resource of links to academic papers. The articles themselves usually provide a pretty good outline of the subject.</p>

<h3 id="should-students-be-deprived-of-social-media">Should Students be Deprived of Social Media?</h3>

<p>As discussed in the podcast, it is surprising to realize that despite knowing the negative impacts of social media, and its cost on our time for relatively little benfit, many people still abuse these outlets. This, we agree is part of the problem; that social media is addictive. This fact plays a large role in a classroom. How can a teacher possibly compete with a program tailor made to abuse psychology to its advantage?</p>

<p>With any addictive compound, there would be public funding for programs that would host presentations and outline the dangers and health effects for students. This happens today for abuse of drugs that could contain fentanyl. It happens with weed. In the 80s and 90s, the subject was cigarettes. My question is what makes social media so different from these other abuses?</p>

<p>I believe the answer is that those who would be conducting the presentations in the first place, and even the creators of social media themselves are also addicted to what they have created.</p>

<p>Herein lies the Social Dilemna. Is it the teachers role to treat students for dependancy and addiction? Our conclusion awaits in our presentation.</p>

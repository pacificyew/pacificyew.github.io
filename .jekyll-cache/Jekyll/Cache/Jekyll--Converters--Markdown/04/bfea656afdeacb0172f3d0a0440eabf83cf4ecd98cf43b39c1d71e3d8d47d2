<h3 id="social-stigma-and-technology-in-classrooms">Social Stigma and Technology in Classrooms</h3>

<p>For the longest time, marijuana was a highly ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù substance in Canada. Simple posession of the plant could land you in jail with a criminal record. Despite this, millions of Canadians still took the risks of using the plant, cultivating it, and selling it. There are reasons for taking this risk. Marijuana has been shown to help treat chronic pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, nausea, and anorexia.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> There is also research to suggest that weed can enhance creativity for some people.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The question emerges, if the substance was so widely used, and had proven benefits in certain cases, why was the interaction with this plant so taboo? Does this stigma still exist after legalization?</p>

<p>Throughout my time in high school, a war was waged against technology in the classroom. I have observed that instead of using technology to their advantage, many teachers, especially those taught industrial models of education, treat phones and computers like digital narcotics. The environment created for me and my peers in high school was not conducive to technological literacy. Instead, teachers would confiscate our property, even going so far as to break them in one case I experienced.</p>

The archtype of ‚Äúgamers‚Äù and other derivatives of tech culture carry the the social stigma regarding techonology; that it destroys creativity and makes you anti-social. Similarly, the ‚Äòstoner‚Äô archtype of the cannabis user propagates the artificial narrative that weed makes individuals lazy, less productive, or less creative. Neither of these stereotypes have any basis in truth.</p>

<p>This narrow-mindedness towards the opportunities that techology presents is similar to Canadas war on weed. Instead of researching the potential of the plant, it was outlawed. 
The time has come to embrace technology in the classroom. Most students own smartphones and computers. Most of them carry their techonology on their person.</p>

<p>To prohibit something only creates uneeded division in any group. To prohibit a behaviour, such as the use of technology, divides a class into those who use phones and those who dont. A result of any division is alienation; being an outsider to a group.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> As Henri Tajfel theorized in his social identity theory, simple divisions into in-groups and out-groups are the basis of prejudice.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> Since this necessarily occurs when a teacher restricts the use of technology, some consequences could be that:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/segregation1.jpg" align="right" width="300px" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Alientated students refuse to participate in class.</li>
  <li>Students are restricted from mode of communication they could effectively use to demonstrate understanding.</li>
  <li>Students fight with the teacher.</li>
  <li>Students fight amongst each other.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benefits-of-technology-in-the-classroom">Benefits of technology in the Classroom</h3>

<p>So, why then should we decriminalize technology in the classroom? As the EDCI 336 speaker said this week, students are going to use their phones in class regardless of what you do. Why not use them to your advantage as a teacher? Furthermore, technology influences every aspect of life now from job seeking to picking up your groceries. To not teach students the benefits an pitfalls of technology would be doing them a disservice.</p>

<p>In the digital age, some people just use technology as their primary mode of communication. This fact should not be construed as a disorder but rather a utilization of available tools. The progress of research as a species has produced a new set of tools that our parents never had, and hence, a generational gap. This occurred with the advent of the printing press, again with telephones, automobiles etc., Vsauce has a good video discussing how technology creates generational gaps.</p>

<p><br />
Tech literacy is real, and teachers need to account for students who use technology as a means of communicating. Many apps and programs can help complex learners demonstrate their understanding of a subject in a way that has never been possible before.</p>

<p>As platforms, many social media outlets facilitate a level personal expression that students might be uncomfortable exercising in person. Showcasing art, projects, and other work can be done in an ethically responsible way through the internet. These platforms also have the power to connect otherwise disparate groups of people which can have both positive and negative consequences, but for the sake of this argument, it can help facilitate discussions between students which otherwise might not have happened.</p>

<p>The internet is also the largest source of information humans have ever had immediate access to. Although this fact, and the way it is employed is also a double-edged sword, the efficiency with which students can now learn basic concepts through the use of the internet is reall a force to be harnessed. Take for example math. Many practice problems for any high school unit are available and are a google search away. Step-by-step instructions are available to help those who need the extra hand. Although this would seem to render the role of a teacher useless, it takes one to teach students how to use these tools.</p>

<h3 id="pitfalls-of-technology-in-the-classroom">Pitfalls of Technology in the Classroom</h3>

<p>To extend the analogy made at the beginning of this post slightly further, just like weed, technology can be addicting.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> As a result, like anything addictive, excess use can be detrimental leading even to dependancy. I have spent this time arguing that technology has its place in classrooms, but I don‚Äôt believe that its role should extend beyond that of a tool.</p>

<p>Overuse of technology can restrict learning in many ways. The most obvious way is that students might not pay attention in class. Although there can be many reasons why a student might refuse to pay attention to a teacher, texting a friend or playing a game are definitely two of them. Generally, I don‚Äôt think teachers are entitled to the attention of their students. I think teachers need to convince their audience that what they say has both meaning and relevance. Failure to capture the attention of students could be a result of a generational gap, or simply a breakdown in communication, but if the majority of students are playing on their phones during class, it probably means the material being taught doesn‚Äôt resonate with them in a meaningful way. Its the job of the teacher to fix this problem rather than condemn a symptom of it.</p>

<p>Addiction to technology can complicate its role as a tool. Earlier the value of social media was pointed out. The pitfalls of social media, especially in the event of an addiction should now be summarized. The concept of an echo chamber emerges by segregating communities based on political, social or any other preferences. As stated before, social identity theory suggests that divisions between individuals necessitates prejudice. In this sense, many social media platforms have actually become the roots for racism and a host of other social problems, despite simultaneously uniting social justice groups. Social media platforms also open another platform for bullying.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/epistemology1.jpg" align="right" width="340xpx" />
Technology, if used incorrectly can miseducate students. A whole host of falsities exist on the internet, some of which are maliciouly and intentionally propagated to the student audience. This is why teaching tech literacy necessarily means teaching critical thinking. The ancient episdemological question; ‚Äúwhat do we know, and how do we know it?‚Äù is very relevant here. To use the internet efficiently, students need to be taught</p>
<ul>
  <li>how to process data and information,</li>
  <li>how to effectively search for what they are looking for,</li>
  <li>how to spot misinformation,</li>
  <li>how to weigh conflicting sources,</li>
  <li>how to identify their own ways of knowing</li>
  <li>how to take what they have learned and construct their own balanced opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these critical aspects of tech literacy can be learned overnight, but this fact reinforces the reasons why we need to bring technology into the classroom.</p>

<p>When meeting new people, I have noticed that individuals mostly refer to their education or occupations as means to quickly define theirselves. Your major or job can suggest a lot about you in a very brief time; your interests, political ideologies, culture, and beyond. Piaget might suggest this is because people can quickly associate a new name and face with their pre-concieved schema of your position<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Unfortunately, the reputation commonly attributed to my academic subject area is of an introverted lab dweller, someone who “does” math, or else a person who translates code. I am a physicist, and whenever I tell people this I am reminded that the same characterization that repels many students from math and science also afflicts my first impressions on potential new friends. This very common perception of physics underlines a systemic problem within education; physics and math are inaccessible fields of knowledge.</p>

<p>A string of literacy events has helped me understand from where these perceptions of the field originate, how systemic elitism and abuse within the fields propogate inacccessibility of knowledge, and how these issues can be mitigated by multiliteracies teaching practices. At Esquimalt, I have met a teacher whose teaching style matches that of most of my own mentors. “Stand and deliver” a heavily regimented dose of rules to associate with previously learned rules. This is done through the form of a lecture during which students take notes. The inividual I observed appeals to a “singular” and “emphatic”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> view of mathematical literacy which, to quote Cope and Kalantzis, means</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>they “accomodate the modern insistence that everyone has at least ‘basic’ levels of competency” and that it “is presented as a single, official or standard form.” (Cope and Kalantzis, 2015)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most subject areas in high school have undergone a transition; students no longer obtain a “literacy”, but “Multiliteracies”. This transition is marked by cross-curricular studies, multi-modal assessment strategies, various forms of expression and other qualities pertaining to global and malleable ways of knowing. Physics and math lag behind most other subjects in terms of this transition. I say this with confidence from the perspective of a physics student who has taken over 100 courses in the subject, and as an observer of current science teachers at Esquimalt. One factor slowing this transition could be that mathmaticians and physicists refuse to regard their discipline as a language, or that doing so is somehow an attack on the objectivity of the “truth” communicated in their topics.</p>

<p>Physics and math are languages. They are modes of communication, and I learned them in the exact same way I would any other language. When learning French, I started with a dictionary to help me translate. I learned verb conjugations, sentance structures and other rules that preface speaking, reading and writing. Obviously, many of these processes were combined to expediate the process but thats the point.</p>

<p>Math and physics are learned through english. Each term or expression has an analagous english translation. In fact, most “natural philosophy” from Aristotle through to Newtons papers on calculus are written almost completely in languages other than math. Math is a set of very complicated statements in English summarized in a very short form. Admitting this precludes nothing about the power this language has to summarize logic and to motivate and predict physical observations. We learn the rules of the language, its structure and symbols, but this process is divorced completely from speaking and storytelling. Paul Lockharts “A Mathematicians Lament”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> captures this perfectly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a painter has just awakened from a similar 
nightmare… I was surprised to find myself in a regular school classroom — no  easels, no tubes of  paint. “Oh  we  don’t  actually  apply  paint  until  high  school,” I was told by the  students. “In  seventh grade we mostly study colors and applicators.” They showed me a worksheet. On one side were swatches of color with blank spaces next to them. They were told to write in the names. “I like painting,” one of them remarked, “they tell me what to do and I do it. It’s easy!””</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-does-literacy-in-physics-currently-look-like">What Does Literacy in Physics Currently Look Like?</h3>

<p>At every level of academia, practitioners of mathematics and physics propagate a narrative that their subjects are only expressible through a single medium and can be understood only by a particular type of individual. This is congruent with the original intention of industrialized public education. Before the mid-1990s, the level of education one achieved and rate of acceptance into the work force were closely related. As Anstey and Bull<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> remark,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If jobs are for life, then the set of 
communication skills and knowledge necessary for those jobs is finite and 
identifiable.”(Anstey and Bull, 2018)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physics literacy is then the basic knowledge of certain rules and applications of math that have been canonized by institutions for the sake of quickly efficiently propelling learners into the work force.</p>

<p>With the adoption of new technologies, education levels now have less bearing on job propsects since many professions are completely automated. The focus of education has now shifted towards a model that produces versatile critical thinkers who can adapt to a wider range of disciplines. In physics and math, the BC curriculum has now been adjusted to allow for holistic “multiliteracies” teaching styles. However, as far as I have observed, the adoption of this new curriculum and the oportunities it presents have very negligably been adopted by physics teachers at any level of education.</p>

<h5 id="understandings">Understandings</h5>

<p>The BC physics curriculum is outlined by 3 components: “understandings”, “competencies” and “content”. Understandings are the 3 or 4 main big ideas of each course. For Physics 12, one big idea is that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Forces can cause linear and circular motion.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the perspective of a physics teacher attempting to adopt a holistic approach to teaching, summarizing the big ideas of each course is useful since it helps plan the time alloted to each segment of the course. It also gives suggestion towards free-inquiry projects which are useful for harnessing the unique learning qualities of each student.</p>

<h5 id="core-competencies">Core Competencies</h5>

<p>Instead of assuming students are a bank of knowledge that can be filled with content, assessment now appeals to social constructivism. Under Lev Vygotskys<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> model, the social interactions of a student with their peers or teacher play a crucial role in their learning. The BC curriculum core competencies refer to the soft skills students gain by participating in class. Teachers are legally obligated to focus on developing these competencies. They should be more important to an educator than the content itself since they are intended to set the standards by which students are ajudicated. For Physics 12, one core competency is</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Processing and analyzing data and information; apply First Peoples perspectives and knowledge, other ways of knowing, and local knowledge as sources of information.<sup id="fnref:5:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shifting the assessment from students’ knowledge of content to their competencies is a major step for multiliteracies education. By developping students’ soft skills using content to guide exploration, learners gain a larger toolset they can use to acquire and transmit knowledge. Taking the time to hook students, harness their creativity, and allowing them to express theirselves through many modes of communciation is what will persuade them to dig deeper into the content of a subject.</p>

<h5 id="content">Content</h5>

<p>The content of the BC curriculum is like the skeleton of a course. It is necessary as a tool for scaffolding the students’ competencies. However, bones alone are no body of their own. Only combined with the “competencies” and “understandings” can a holistic course outline be produced. Under a multiliteracies approach to teaching, content and curriculum are separate and distinct. Instead of running a perpetual circuit of explicating an unchanging textbook, this new curriculum forces teachers to account for a diversity of constantly changing perspectives. “Content” here is simply the list of things students should know. For Physics 12, one piece of content is</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“uniform circular motion: centripetal force and acceleration, [and] changes to apparent weight.<sup id="fnref:5:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>”</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="aversion-to-change">Aversion to Change</h5>

<p>Although the new curriculum provides an impetus for teachers to present math and physics as languages, my experience at Esquimalt has shown me that it does nothing to force mentors to change their practice. In particular, the topic of “transformations” was being taught in a Pre-Calculus 12 class I was observing. The teacher presented it the exact same way that I had been taught ages ago. The new curriculum specifies very little of the content that this individual was teaching, so why not take that opportunity to present the content in ways that more effectively reached the audience? If a teacher can walk into a classroom and teach math in the exact same way one might have done a century ago without backlash suggests to me that the institutionalized definition of “physics literacy” needs to be changed.</p>

<h3 id="multiliteracies-in-physics">Multiliteracies in Physics</h3>

<p>Until this point, I have used the terms “multiliteracies” and “holistic learning” interchangably. The word holistic implies inclusivity; consideration of otherwise disparate ideas. “Multiliteracies”, as opposed to “literacy” refers to a teaching style that incorporates many perspectives on a topic, encourages critical thinking and accounts for multiple modalities of expression and learning. This view on teaching aligns with my drive to present math and physics as languages. Considering all techniques, exercises and projects I have seen used in an English or French class, the possibilities for multiliteracies in physics education now seem endless. To write 2+2=5 carries no more logical weight than “The Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
 And the mome raths outgrabe…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The claims that physics can only be taught through a single medium and can only be learned by specific people are both fallacies. Simply by presenting using many mediums, a teacher will reach more people by covering a wider spectrum of their learners’ preferred modes of communication. As a multiliteracies teacher, I would incorporate a more social constructivist model in my classroom.</p>

<p>Universities and high school administration are struggling to determine why the disciplines of math and physics are so heavily dominated by white economically stable men. I believe it is because these fields do not accomodate multiliteracies. Of all the science teachers I asked at Esquimalt, none of them knew how to incorporate indigenous ways of knowing into their classrooms. The teacher who sparked my idea for this post effectively said that math is by nature not an indigenous creation and therefore was not eligible to be indigenized. Those who have survived the high attrition rate of that particular Pre-Calculus 12 course already fit the alarming demographic that composes our universities.</p>

<p>Having experienced the whole programme, and with access to undergraduate grading statistics, I know that assessment plays a large role in discrimination in my field. To begin with, the method by which knowledge in the subject is assessed is highly questionable. Your mark is determined by timed exam. In most cases, the 3 hour final worth upwards of 50% could consist of 1 to 5 questions only. An average semester could have 6 of these exams placed back to back on the same day. At SFU, people are not marked on a rubric or a standardized statistical curve. Instead, quotas are created for a particular class; ratios of grades ajudicators intend on distributing. Half the class has already failed before enrolling. When performance is actually tallied from exams, student numbers are placed on a list from highest to lowest. Depending on the number of “A” grades the department intended on distributing, that number of names from the top of the list move on. Those at the bottom of the list - in the case of my Calculus 1 class, 60% of those enrolled - fail. In a game this ruthless and far removed from understandings, only the most priviledged survive. Those who must care for their children, work to survive, or face any host of other adversities, statistically speaking, will not graduate.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I feel alone in my view that physics education requires multiliteracies teaching practices. There are very few people who survive the attrition rate of the degree and much fewer who understand what factors lead them there. Physics and math education lag behind all other disciplines in holistic teaching because of prejudice rooted in the ignorance of other ways of knowing. Since Math and Physics are languages, and this fact does not detract from their ability to outline truth,</p>

<p>I can confirm that the discrimination that roots itself in high school blooms in university.</p>

<p>I want to elaborate on the institutionalized discrimination that continues to plague university-level physics since it motivates why there is pushback to accept multiliteracies teaching</p>

<p>further contribute further about discrimination in physics. Grading schemes in first-year SFU guarantee</p>

<p>As a teacher, I hope to increase the vocabulary and</p>

<p>After a very long discussion alone with my Wednesday observations coordinator after classes, I have come to a realization about physics that I believe is fundamental to the way I will teach it</p>

<p>To make an analogy, a classroom is like a garden. The teacher is the sun; they provide the students with the kick they need to develop. Seedlings grow towards the sun and by extention, students generally follow the direction teachers give them. The sun also goes away at the end of the day. If “competencies” are the shapes the seedlings take as they grow to respond to their environment and “understandings” are the boxes in which they grow, then content would be</p>

<p>Competencies are the component of the BC curiculum that have inerited from simple content the standards by which students are adjudicated.</p>

<p>I could probably walk into the classroom and teach math in the exact same way a teacher might have done a century ago without much institutional backlash. This indicates to me that not enough has been done to motivate changes.</p>

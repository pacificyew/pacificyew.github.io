<h3 id="mathcatcher">Mathcatcher</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/mathcatcher.html">Mathcatcher</a> is a math education program developped by a team of engaged professors at SFU. The motivation behind the program is to engage a wide demographic of students through indigenous storytelling. The programm does outreach and workshops at schools around Canada and has succeeded in constructing a network of math and indigenous language educators around the counrty.</p>

<p>I am currently a research assistant for the Math department at SFU under Dr. Veselin Jungic. Veselin is effectively the father of the project and he is responsible for organizing pretty much everything. I am responsible for editing and directing the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/mathcatcher/StoriesMovies.html">Mathcatcher videos</a>. In particular, I have been working on the project since the beginning of this year and have produced all of the French, Spanish, a Gitxsan and a few Wet’suwet’en videos.</p>

<p>I haven’t been posting as often as usual due to having to deal with ICBC and finding a new car which has occupied all my time. I have also been working on this exact project, so I decided that I would use it as a blog post. I employ Adobe Premiere to edit these videos and it has taken me a few years of hobby video-editing projects to get to this point. My editing involved layered masking in some circumstances to include translated titles while still preserving the original art of the video. Audio editing is also involved since some videos include soundscapes, some of which I record myself. There was a lecture a few weeks ago regarding video and graphic design editing. I believe my work with Mathcatcher is relevant.</p>

This post summarizes most of the ideas featured in our classes over the last few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="the-park">The Park</h3>

<h5 id="where">Where?</h5>
<p>Konuckson Park is located in the center of ten-mile point in Saanich, 10 minutes south of the university by bike. It is a walk away from Cadboro bay and is worth the hike because I believe it contains one of the largest Cottonwoods on the peninsula.</p>

<h5 id="when">When?</h5>
<p>I cant for the life of me find any historical documents about the park or its previous uses. Even the Saanich Parks website doesn’t have an article about Konuckson. I resort to Provincial GIS layers to try and infer what the history of the area is. It likely isn’t accurate, but all I’m trying to do is guess where the biggest trees are so. Yeah.</p>

<h5 id="what">What?</h5>
<p>The image above is a city zoning map found on <a href="https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/archives/collections-research.html">the Saanich archives.</a> It depicts the city subdivisions as cut in the year 1948. The entirety of what is now Konuckson park lies over the block of lots between Phylis, Bedford, Tudor and Minnie. These roads’ names have since changed, but what doesn’t make sense to me is where these subdivisions went. There are something like 50 lots here which somehow have become a park. More digging using government layers on <a href="https://maps.gov.bc.ca/ess/hm/imap4m/">imapsBC</a> reveals only about 10 of those original lots (the blocks south and north of the semi-circular lot 5) were turned into park. Since this was once private land, I did not expect to find anything old or big since settler landowners were privy to logging and clearing lots for agriculture.</p>

As a curious tangent, I also found an interesting layer shaded light green below through imapsBC. The dark green areas are parks with the biggest one in the center being Konuckson. The light green patches overlap privately owned lots but are nevertheless marked “Registered and Recognized historic places”. The <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/a8d72ad9-2379-4d6d-9ff7-f3d0527dfb80">government data catalogue</a> describes this layer as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Historic Environment Spatial Layer contains polygons and related attributes representing post-1846 historic places in British Columbia that are recorded on the provincial heritage register. It does not include any archaeological site information.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>”</p>
</blockquote>

Some of them actually are archaological sites, but this isn’t the place to talk about that. Most of them are “historic residences”. Other than that, its seems what were “roads” through the park no longer exist. I guess houses were never built on the Konuckson blocks, and the land in some places may be mostly undisturbed.</p>

<h5 id="who">Who?</h5>
<p>Judging by the way the park has been zoned historically, I expect the land management of this area to have been dominated by settlers throughout the lifespans of any trees that now live there. I know in some places, indigenous groups maintain gardens and spiritual trails to this day. I don’t know if that would be the case here considering the circumstances, but I will tread lightly. It is in a very convenient location close to Cadboro bay, and its beyond question that the area was used extensively by groups here prior to settler arrival.</p>

<p>Settlers may have modified the land by clearing, burning, or introducing new species, pests and diseases into the native ecosystem here. This wouldn’t really be conducive to saving large trees.</p>

<h5 id="why">Why?</h5>
<p>Trees in parks generally aren’t cut down after they become parks. Its good reason to suspect that larger undisturbed areas might be found there. Also, the topographical shape of Konuckson is kind of like a bowl. It collects water, and the center of the park is quite wet; conducive to growing Cedar and Cottonwood. This is definitely an area to scout around.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-found">What we Found</h3>

Konuckson has many trails covering the entire park. Its hard to get lost if you know which way you want to walk. Some of the trails look maintained by the city. Others look like they were made by deer or people infrequently walking by. I don’t know what the indigenous relationship with the area is, but my girlfriend pointed out Rattlesnake everywhere in one particular area. There was a large boulder, a semi-circle of smaller boulders, and some older Arbutus. Perfect place for a campfire.</p>

<p>The largest treee was easily the biggest Cottonwood I’ve ever seen right in the middle of the park where its the wettest. There are two Arbutus in one region that are about a meter across as well. The locations and measurements that we took are shown in the map below. Go check them out!</p>

This post is a reflection regarding the presentation with Jeff Hopkins.</p>

<h3 id="inquiry">Inquiry</h3>

<p>Most subject areas in high school have undergone a transition; students no longer obtain a ‚Äúliteracy‚Äù, but ‚ÄúMultiliteracies‚Äù. This transition is marked by cross-curricular studies, multi-modal assessment strategies, various forms of expression and other qualities pertaining to global and malleable ways of knowing. Physics and math lag behind most other subjects in terms of this transition. I say this with confidence from the perspective of a physics student who has taken over 100 courses in the subject, and as an observer of current science teachers at Esquimalt. One factor slowing this transition could be that mathematicians and physicists refuse to regard their discipline as a language, or that doing so is somehow an attack on the objectivity of the ‚Äútruth‚Äù communicated in their topics.</p>

<p>The underlying thesis in education at PSII is inquiry, and I believe inquiry is best facilitated by multiliteracies pedagogy.</p>

<h3 id="employing-social-constructivism">Employing Social Constructivism</h3>

<p>As a multiliteracies teacher, I would incorporate a more social constructivist model in my classroom. Starting with the premise that math is a language, I plan to use inquiry-based learning, indigenous ways of knowing, collaborative projects, and assessments incorporating creative and critical thinking to devlop students‚Äô competencies and understandings. If components of content act as vehicles to scaffold learning rather than structure it, students have more flexibility to explore topics in math that interest them. By working collaboratively, I would argue with the research of Vygotsky and Piaget behind me, that students learn more effectively. The rate at which I would present material would be tailored to the progress of the class, not the size of a textbook. This ensures content stays within their zone of proximal development. Without the race against time to cover enormous contents, students have the chance to internalize and reflect on their learning as well.</p>

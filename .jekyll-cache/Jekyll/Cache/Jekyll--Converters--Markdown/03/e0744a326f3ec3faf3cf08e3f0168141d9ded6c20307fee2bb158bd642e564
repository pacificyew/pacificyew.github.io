This post dives into some of the history of New Westminster because I find it interesting and I believe contextualizes the story of the trees that have survived there.</p>

<h3 id="the-park">The Park</h3>

<h5 id="where">Where?</h5>

<p>Although this original project was meant to explore forests around the Saanich peninsula, I had the chance to walk around my hometown of New West a few weeks ago and managed to take some measurements. Queens Park refers both to the neighbourhood in which I grew up and a very large area of land that is a municipal park in New Westminster. New Westminster deserves its own post in this blog just to give context to the neighbourhood.</p>

Firstly, its old. Not pre-colonial old, but fairly close to it. The town was formerly the capital of BC, and lies on the traditional territory of the Qiq√©yt first nation. More about this later.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think a more proud stronghold of proud colonial loyalists exists in such strength anywhere else in BC. That includes here in Victoria. New Westers are fanatics about where they live and relish romanticized details of what history they choose to remember. The royal engineer responsible for some of the civil planning in the town, Richard Moodie apparently ‚Äòwanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness‚Äô and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, ‚Äòstyled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the Crown and of the robe‚Äô<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. To this end, he succeeded. The descendents of the founders of this town still largely live in New West. I was taught by some of them. Many of the attendees of New Wests Schools will be familiar with cringe-worthy manditory colonial traditions and historical hogwash that plagued our public education. The name of the city was given by Queen Victoria herself for what thats worth. Apparently, she didn‚Äôt like the name ‚ÄòQueensborough‚Äô.</p>

<p>The city was built on stolen land. It was originally used by the Tsawwassen for processing fish. Ironically, this is still performed today, in a very different context. I know very little about the Tsawwassen and how they used the land I grew up on. At this point, few people do because of the political dominance of settler culture there. The BC governments ‚ÄòGeographical Names‚Äô tool lists the region as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúA place formerly inhabited by First Nations‚Äô people, with no current population or that is usually uninhabited ‚Ä¶ An ancient Tsawwassen village site known as qiq8 (the Coast Salish spelling in 2005 draft for Tsawwassen Final Agreement), is located on the east bank of the Fraser River under todays Patullo Bridge.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its safe to say that very little to none of the natural components are traditionally culturally modified. Very few trees in this region are old enough to pre-date settlement by colonial powers which occurred through the early 1800s.</p>

<p>This is becoming a rant, but I made it a point of this inquiry project to examine the cultures and histories of different regions as a means of predicting where I might find the biggest trees. I swear this does have a purpose.</p>

<h5 id="why">Why</h5>

<p>New Westminsters‚Äô strategic placement at the mouth of the fraser gave colonial powers control over the use of this waterway. The city had military intentions with onslaughts of American gold miners threatening the dominion of the Hudsons Bay company (in lieu of the Queen). Until 1980, it hosted the pen; a big stone prison. Next door, you would find a mental asylum for children which I promise, looks just about as horrible as it sounds. These two cheery places as well as the graveyards for their occupants are fittingly on the land originally zoned as the ‚ÄòQueens Park‚Äô.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Fraser, it was also a prime location for a resource extraction port. I was told in elementary school that visiting folks from Victoria nicknamed the town ‚Äòstumpville‚Äô after it was extensively logged clear in the mid 1800s. Probably not a great idea considering the steepness of the hill it was built on and the risk logging poses on landslides, but none have yet happened as far as I know.</p>

<p>New Westminster was also supposed to be the terminus station for the CPR, which after some money moved around between rich land-owners downtown, came to skip New Westminster entirely. Even the highway 1 which was built in 1964 completely passes by New Westminster to its north. Knowing the attitudes of the people who live there, I can say with confidence that New West has remained a separate municipal entity intentionally. The municipal zoning around Queens park is one of a kind. ‚ÄòHeritage‚Äô protection is violent there. The running joke is that there are only two kinds of land in New West; parks and strata.</p>

<p>It would make sense, considering the towns‚Äô history of resource extraction and culture of development and colonialism would leave little chance of any large trees surviving in this area.</p>

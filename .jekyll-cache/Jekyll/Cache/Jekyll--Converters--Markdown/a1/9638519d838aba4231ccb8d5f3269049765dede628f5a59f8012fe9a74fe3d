This website is no longer in its infancy. This post outlines the process by which I created this blog.</p>

<p>I don’t really have much coding experience. Most of my data crunching was done in MATLAB in my undergrad. I had a course in Fortran, but those skills dont really translate to useful languages that are actually used today. The most useful thing i learned was navigating my computer using bash. Creating and deleting files, editing documents, and writing programs from the command line. UNIX based computers do this with a “terminal” program, Windows computers have DOS and whatever they call their command line. This is basically where my knowledge ended before this program. Anyone who is looking at this post for advice, look elsewhere; I basically just banged my head against it for a couple months.</p>

Homebrew is a free open-source package manager that operates from command line on UNIX-based operating systems. It was created in 2009. I used Homebrew to install jekyll and its dependancies as well as other useful software that I didnt know existed before this. Homebrew installs into
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
/usr/local
</code>
by default. Hit Cmd + Shift + . to see otherwise hidden folders in Finder. Dont delete any of them for no reason though, apple hid them for a reason. Running
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
</code>
in Terminal will install Homebrew. The <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew webiste</a> contains analytics data, programs, changelogs etc.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a program that compiles websites. It is written in Ruby by Github founder Tom Preston-Werner. A host of volunteers maintains the software, and its most stable release was 4.2.0 in 2020.</p>

Reflection about integrating multiliteracies into physics and math classrooms</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This post is an exploration of literacy events that occurred during my observations at Esquimalt high school. In this reflection, I describe how my views on my fields of math and physics have become increasingly critical as I learn more of the multiliteracies methodology. Even after the shift to a more holistic curriculum, present math and physics teachers and professors struggle to acknowledge that they are teaching a language. Appealing to very narrow perceptions of literacy in these topics, modern students are exposed to exorbitant amounts of rigid content. Explication is overwhelmingly performed through the single medium of lecture, and assessment though standardized exams. I later evaluate the difference between literacy and multiliteracies focusing on what modern physics and math literacy looks like. I then construct a working definition of multiliteracies and describe how I would incorporate the methodologies into my own classroom.</p>

When meeting new people, I have noticed that individuals mostly refer to their education or occupations as means to quickly define theirselves. Your major or job can suggest a lot about you in a very brief time; your interests, political ideologies, culture, and beyond. Piaget might suggest this is because people can quickly associate a new name and face with their pre-concieved schema of your position<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Unfortunately, the reputation commonly attributed to my academic subject area is of an introverted lab dweller, someone who “does” math, or else a person who translates code. I am a physicist, and whenever I tell people this I am reminded that the same characterization that repels many students from math and science also afflicts my first impressions on potential new friends. This very common perception of physics underlines a systemic problem within education; physics and math are inaccessible fields of knowledge.</p>

A string of literacy events has helped me understand from where these perceptions of the field originate, how systemic elitism and abuse within the fields propagate inaccessibility of knowledge, and how these issues can be mitigated by multiliteracies teaching practices. At Esquimalt, I have met a teacher whose teaching style matches that of most of my own mentors. “Stand and deliver” a heavily regimented dose of rules to associate with previously learned rules. This is done through the form of a lecture during which students take notes. The individual I observed appeals to a “singular” and “emphatic” view of mathematical literacy which, to quote Cope and Kalantzis (2015), means they</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“accommodate the modern insistence that everyone has at least ‘basic’ levels of competency” and that it “is presented as a single, official or standard form.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/352ass1/c.jpg" align="right" width="360px" />
Most subject areas in high school have undergone a transition; students no longer obtain a “literacy”, but “Multiliteracies”. This transition is marked by cross-curricular studies, multi-modal assessment strategies, various forms of expression and other qualities pertaining to global and malleable ways of knowing. Physics and math lag behind most other subjects in terms of this transition. I say this with confidence from the perspective of a physics student who has taken over 100 courses in the subject, and as an observer of current science teachers at Esquimalt. One factor slowing this transition could be that mathematicians and physicists refuse to regard their discipline as a language, or that doing so is somehow an attack on the objectivity of the “truth” communicated in their topics.</p>

<p>Physics and math are languages. They are modes of communication, and I learned them in the exact same way I would any other language. When learning French, I started with a dictionary to help me translate. I learned verb conjugations, sentence structures and other rules that preface speaking, reading and writing. Obviously, many of these processes were combined to expedite the process but thats the point.</p>

<p>Math and physics are learned through english. Each term or expression has an analogous english translation. In fact, most “natural philosophy” from Aristotle through to Newtons papers on calculus are written almost completely in languages other than math. Math is a set of very complicated statements in English summarized in a very short form. Admitting this precludes nothing about the power this language has to summarize logic and to motivate and predict physical observations. We learn the rules of the language, its structure and symbols, but this process is divorced completely from speaking and storytelling. Paul Lockhart (2009) captures this perfectly in “A Mathematicians Lament”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a painter has just awakened from a similar 
nightmare… I was surprised to find myself in a regular school classroom — no  easels, no tubes of  paint. “Oh  we  don’t  actually  apply  paint  until  high  school,” I was told by the  students. “In  seventh grade we mostly study colors and applicators.” They showed me a worksheet. On one side were swatches of color with blank spaces next to them. They were told to write in the names. “I like painting,” one of them remarked, “they tell me what to do and I do it. It’s easy!”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="what-does-literacy-in-physics-currently-look-like">What Does Literacy in Physics Currently Look Like?</h3>

<p>At every level of academia, practitioners of mathematics and physics propagate a narrative that their subjects are only expressible through a single medium and can be understood only by a particular type of individual. This is congruent with the original intention of industrialized public education. Before the mid-1990s, the level of education one achieved and rate of acceptance into the work force were closely related. As Anstey and Bull (2018) remark,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If jobs are for life, then the set of 
communication skills and knowledge necessary for those jobs is finite and 
identifiable.”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physics literacy is then the basic knowledge of certain rules and applications of math that have been canonized by institutions for the sake of quickly efficiently propelling learners into the work force.</p>

<p>With the adoption of new technologies, education levels now have less bearing on job prospects since many professions are completely automated. The focus of education has now shifted towards a model that produces versatile critical thinkers who can adapt to a wider range of disciplines. In physics and math, the BC curriculum has now been adjusted to allow for holistic “multiliteracies” teaching styles. However, as far as I have observed, the adoption of this new curriculum and the opportunities it presents have very negligibly been adopted by physics teachers at any level of education.
<img src="/assets/352ass1/cur.png" align="right" width="350px" /></p>

<h5 id="understandings">Understandings</h5>

<p>The BC physics curriculum (2021) is outlined by 3 components: “understandings”, “competencies” and “content”. Understandings are the 3 or 4 main big ideas of each course. For Physics 12, one big idea is that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Forces can cause linear and circular motion.”<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the perspective of a physics teacher attempting to adopt a holistic approach to teaching, summarizing the big ideas of each course is useful since it helps plan the time allotted to each segment of the course. It also gives suggestion towards free-inquiry projects which are useful for harnessing the unique learning qualities of each student.</p>

<h5 id="core-competencies">Core Competencies</h5>

<p>Instead of assuming students are a bank of knowledge that can be filled with content, assessment now appeals to social constructivism. Under Lev Vygotskys<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> model, the social interactions of a student with their peers or teacher play a crucial role in their learning. The BC curriculum core competencies refer to the soft skills students gain by participating in class. Teachers are legally obligated to focus on developing these competencies. They should be more important to an educator than the content itself since they are intended to set the standards by which students are adjudicated. For Physics 12, one core competency is</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Processing and analyzing data and information; apply First Peoples perspectives and knowledge, other ways of knowing, and local knowledge as sources of information.”<sup id="fnref:5:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shifting the assessment from students’ knowledge of content to their competencies is a major step for multiliteracies education. By developping students’ soft skills using content to guide exploration, learners gain a larger toolset they can use to acquire and transmit knowledge. Taking the time to hook students, harness their creativity, and allowing them to express theirselves through many modes of communciation is what will persuade them to dig deeper into the content of a subject.</p>

<h5 id="content">Content</h5>

<p>The content of the BC curriculum is like the skeleton of a course. It is necessary as a tool for scaffolding the students’ competencies. However, bones alone are no body of their own. Only combined with the “competencies” and “understandings” can a holistic course outline be produced. Under a multiliteracies approach to teaching, content and curriculum are separate and distinct. Instead of running a perpetual circuit of explicating an unchanging textbook, this new curriculum forces teachers to account for a diversity of constantly changing perspectives. “Content” here is simply the list of things students should know. For Physics 12, one piece of content is</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“uniform circular motion: centripetal force and acceleration … changes to apparent weight.”<sup id="fnref:5:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="aversion-to-change">Aversion to Change</h5>

<p><img src="/assets/352ass1/e.jpg" align="right" width="350px" />
Although the new curriculum provides an impetus for teachers to present math and physics as languages, my experience at Esquimalt has shown me that it does nothing to force mentors to change their practice. In particular, the topic of “transformations” was being taught in a Pre-Calculus 12 class I was observing. The teacher presented it the exact same way that I had been taught ages ago. The new curriculum specifies very little of the content that this individual was teaching, so why not take that opportunity to present the content in ways that more effectively reached the audience? If a teacher can walk into a classroom and teach math in the exact same way one might have done a century ago without backlash suggests to me that the institutionalized definition of “physics literacy” needs to be changed.</p>

<h3 id="multiliteracies-in-physics">Multiliteracies in Physics</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/352ass1/f.jpg" align="right" width="375px" />
Until this point, I have used the terms “multiliteracies” and “holistic learning” interchangably. The word holistic implies inclusivity; consideration of otherwise disparate ideas. “Multiliteracies”, as opposed to “literacy” refers to a teaching style that incorporates many perspectives on a topic, encourages critical thinking and accounts for multiple modalities of expression and learning. This view on teaching aligns with my drive to present math and physics as languages. Considering all techniques, exercises and projects I have seen used in an English or French class, the possibilities for multiliteracies in physics education now seem endless. Gibberish in math can be intentional. Language does not need to communicate logical statements. In “The Jabberwocky” Lewis Carroll uses this as a literary technique:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/assets/352ass1/g.jpg" align="right" width="340px" />
“’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves          <br />Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:       <br />All mimsy were the borogoves,       <br />And the mome raths outgrabe…”<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a multiliteracies teacher, I would incorporate a more social constructivist model in my classroom. Starting with the premise that math is a language, I plan to use inquiry-based learning, indigenous ways of knowing, collaborative projects, and assessments incorporating creative and critical thinking to devlop students’ competencies and understandings. If components of content act as vehicles to scaffold learning rather than structure it, students have more flexibility to explore topics in math that interest them. By working collaboratively, I would argue with the research of Vygotsky and Piaget behind me, that students learn more effectively. The rate at which I would present material would be tailored to the progress of the class, not the size of a textbook. This ensures content stays within their zone of proximal development. Without the race against time to cover enormous contents,</p>

<p>The claims that physics and math can only be taught through a single medium and can only be learned by specific people are both fallacies. Universities and high school administration are struggling to determine why the disciplines of math and physics are so heavily dominated by white economically stable men. I believe it is because these fields do not accomodate multiliteracies. Only the most priviledged and economically stable individuals skilled at responding to standardized exams are able to survive high attrition rates of physics and math programs. Students responsible for caring for family, those who work, and those who cant effectively demonstrate their knowledge through prescribed standardized exams statistically do not graudate. Only a specific demographic of people can accumulate the advantages needed to get through their programs, and proceed to employ the same teaching strategies on the next generation of students. Of all the science teachers I asked at Esquimalt, none of them knew how to incorporate indigenous ways of knowing into their classrooms. The teacher who sparked my idea for this post effectively said that math is by nature not an indigenous creation and therefore was not eligible to be indigenized. Those who have survived the high attrition rate of that particular Pre-Calculus 12 course already fit the alarming demographic that composes our universities.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/352ass1/i.jpg" align="right" width="375px" />
I now introduce myself as a theoretical linguist because I dont want to be associated with the inaccessible fields that are physics and math. By addressing the way physics and math are taught, and modernizing them to account for multiliteracies, I believe much of the discrimination and elitism endemic to these fields would disappear. It is time for teachers in this field to Ted Aokis view that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“education is not a journey, rather to be educated means to travel with a different view”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are three main understandings I have derived from this reflection activity. Firstly, teaching physics and math as languages is a technique much more conducive to integrating multiliteracies methodologies. Math is more than a colleciton of rules, and just like any language can be manipulated for artistic purposes. Secondly, integrating a multiliteracies methodology could have the effect of enhancing the learning experience for students. A more diverse demographic of students is likely to participate in a class that allows many modes of expression, collaboration, and creative inquiry-based assessment. Thirdly, and most importantly, integrating a more holistic view of math and physics within classrooms will help dissolve institutionalized elitism and discrimination which have ultimately always defined the fields of physics and math. Students empowered to use math to tell stories, to model their cultural traditions, and to otherwise communicate will be the ultimate scientists. Making these fields accessible to a demographic of people previously barred from research, academia may be exposed to perspectives never before considered. Math and physics require creativity, otherwise they would never change.</p>

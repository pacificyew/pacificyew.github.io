Reflection about integrating multiliteracies into physics and math classrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is an exploration of literacy events that occurred during my observations at Esquimalt high school. In this reflection, I describe how my views on my fields of math and physics have become increasingly critical as I learn more of the multiliteracies methodology. Even after the shift to a more holistic curriculum, present math and physics teachers and professors struggle to acknowledge that they are teaching a language. Appealing to very narrow perceptions of literacy in these topics, modern students are exposed to exorbitant amounts of rigid content. Explication is overwhelmingly performed through the single medium of lecture, and assessment though standardized exams. I later evaluate the difference between literacy and multiliteracies focusing on what modern physics and math literacy looks like. I then construct a working definition of multiliteracies and describe how I would incorporate the methodologies into my own classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;physics-is-a-language&quot;&gt;Physics is a Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/meme1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;370px&quot; /&gt;
When meeting new people, I have noticed that individuals mostly refer to their education or occupations as means to quickly define theirselves. Your major or job can suggest a lot about you in a very brief time; your interests, political ideologies, culture, and beyond. Piaget might suggest this is because people can quickly associate a new name and face with their pre-concieved schema of your position&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unfortunately, the reputation commonly attributed to my academic subject area is of an introverted lab dweller, someone who “does” math, or else a person who translates code. I am a physicist, and whenever I tell people this I am reminded that the same characterization that repels many students from math and science also afflicts my first impressions on potential new friends. This very common perception of physics underlines a systemic problem within education; physics and math are inaccessible fields of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 3&quot; /&gt;
A string of literacy events has helped me understand from where these perceptions of the field originate, how systemic elitism and abuse within the fields propagate inaccessibility of knowledge, and how these issues can be mitigated by multiliteracies teaching practices. At Esquimalt, I have met a teacher whose teaching style matches that of most of my own mentors. “Stand and deliver” a heavily regimented dose of rules to associate with previously learned rules. This is done through the form of a lecture during which students take notes. The individual I observed appeals to a “singular” and “emphatic” view of mathematical literacy which, to quote Cope and Kalantzis (2015), means they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“accommodate the modern insistence that everyone has at least ‘basic’ levels of competency” and that it “is presented as a single, official or standard form.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/c.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;360px&quot; /&gt;
Most subject areas in high school have undergone a transition; students no longer obtain a “literacy”, but “Multiliteracies”. This transition is marked by cross-curricular studies, multi-modal assessment strategies, various forms of expression and other qualities pertaining to global and malleable ways of knowing. Physics and math lag behind most other subjects in terms of this transition. I say this with confidence from the perspective of a physics student who has taken over 100 courses in the subject, and as an observer of current science teachers at Esquimalt. One factor slowing this transition could be that mathematicians and physicists refuse to regard their discipline as a language, or that doing so is somehow an attack on the objectivity of the “truth” communicated in their topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics and math are languages. They are modes of communication, and I learned them in the exact same way I would any other language. When learning French, I started with a dictionary to help me translate. I learned verb conjugations, sentence structures and other rules that preface speaking, reading and writing. Obviously, many of these processes were combined to expedite the process but thats the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math and physics are learned through english. Each term or expression has an analogous english translation. In fact, most “natural philosophy” from Aristotle through to Newtons papers on calculus are written almost completely in languages other than math. Math is a set of very complicated statements in English summarized in a very short form. Admitting this precludes nothing about the power this language has to summarize logic and to motivate and predict physical observations. We learn the rules of the language, its structure and symbols, but this process is divorced completely from speaking and storytelling. Paul Lockhart (2009) captures this perfectly in “A Mathematicians Lament”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a painter has just awakened from a similar 
nightmare… I was surprised to find myself in a regular school classroom — no  easels, no tubes of  paint. “Oh  we  don’t  actually  apply  paint  until  high  school,” I was told by the  students. “In  seventh grade we mostly study colors and applicators.” They showed me a worksheet. On one side were swatches of color with blank spaces next to them. They were told to write in the names. “I like painting,” one of them remarked, “they tell me what to do and I do it. It’s easy!”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-literacy-in-physics-currently-look-like&quot;&gt;What Does Literacy in Physics Currently Look Like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every level of academia, practitioners of mathematics and physics propagate a narrative that their subjects are only expressible through a single medium and can be understood only by a particular type of individual. This is congruent with the original intention of industrialized public education. Before the mid-1990s, the level of education one achieved and rate of acceptance into the work force were closely related. As Anstey and Bull (2018) remark,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If jobs are for life, then the set of 
communication skills and knowledge necessary for those jobs is finite and 
identifiable.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics literacy is then the basic knowledge of certain rules and applications of math that have been canonized by institutions for the sake of quickly efficiently propelling learners into the work force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of new technologies, education levels now have less bearing on job prospects since many professions are completely automated. The focus of education has now shifted towards a model that produces versatile critical thinkers who can adapt to a wider range of disciplines. In physics and math, the BC curriculum has now been adjusted to allow for holistic “multiliteracies” teaching styles. However, as far as I have observed, the adoption of this new curriculum and the opportunities it presents have very negligibly been adopted by physics teachers at any level of education.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/cur.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;understandings&quot;&gt;Understandings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BC physics curriculum (2021) is outlined by 3 components: “understandings”, “competencies” and “content”. Understandings are the 3 or 4 main big ideas of each course. For Physics 12, one big idea is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Forces can cause linear and circular motion.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a physics teacher attempting to adopt a holistic approach to teaching, summarizing the big ideas of each course is useful since it helps plan the time allotted to each segment of the course. It also gives suggestion towards free-inquiry projects which are useful for harnessing the unique learning qualities of each student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;core-competencies&quot;&gt;Core Competencies&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of assuming students are a bank of knowledge that can be filled with content, assessment now appeals to social constructivism. Under Lev Vygotskys&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; model, the social interactions of a student with their peers or teacher play a crucial role in their learning. The BC curriculum core competencies refer to the soft skills students gain by participating in class. Teachers are legally obligated to focus on developing these competencies. They should be more important to an educator than the content itself since they are intended to set the standards by which students are adjudicated. For Physics 12, one core competency is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Processing and analyzing data and information; apply First Peoples perspectives and knowledge, other ways of knowing, and local knowledge as sources of information.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting the assessment from students’ knowledge of content to their competencies is a major step for multiliteracies education. By developing students’ soft skills using content to guide exploration, learners gain a larger tool-set they can use to acquire and transmit knowledge. Taking the time to hook students, harness their creativity, and allowing them to express their selves through many modes of communication is what will persuade them to dig deeper into the content of a subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of the BC curriculum is like the skeleton of a course. It is necessary as a tool for scaffolding the students’ competencies. However, bones alone are no body of their own. Only combined with the “competencies” and “understandings” can a holistic course outline be produced. Under a multiliteracies approach to teaching, content and curriculum are separate and distinct. Instead of running a perpetual circuit of explicating an unchanging textbook, this new curriculum forces teachers to account for a diversity of constantly changing perspectives. “Content” here is simply the list of things students should know. For Physics 12, one piece of content is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“uniform circular motion: centripetal force and acceleration … changes to apparent weight.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;aversion-to-change&quot;&gt;Aversion to Change&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/e.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;
Although the new curriculum provides an impetus for teachers to present math and physics as languages, my experience at Esquimalt has shown me that it does nothing to force mentors to change their practice. In particular, the topic of “transformations” was being taught in a Pre-Calculus 12 class I was observing. The teacher presented it the exact same way that I had been taught ages ago. The new curriculum specifies very little of the content that this individual was teaching, so why not take that opportunity to present the content in ways that more effectively reached the audience? If a teacher can walk into a classroom and teach math in the exact same way one might have done a century ago without backlash suggests to me that the institutionalized definition of “physics literacy” needs to be changed.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiliteracies-in-physics&quot;&gt;Multiliteracies in Physics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/f.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; /&gt;
Until this point, I have used the terms “multiliteracies” and “holistic learning” interchangeably. The word holistic implies inclusiveness; consideration of otherwise disparate ideas. “Multiliteracies”, as opposed to “literacy” refers to a teaching style that incorporates many perspectives on a topic, encourages critical thinking and accounts for multiple modalities of expression and learning. This view on teaching aligns with my drive to present math and physics as languages. Considering all techniques, exercises and projects I have seen used in an English or French class, the possibilities for multiliteracies in physics education now seem endless. Gibberish in math can be intentional. Language does not need to communicate logical statements. In “The Jabberwocky” Lewis Carroll uses this as a literary technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/g.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;340px&quot; /&gt;
“’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves          &lt;br /&gt;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:       &lt;br /&gt;All mimsy were the borogoves,       &lt;br /&gt;And the mome raths outgrabe…”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a multiliteracies teacher, I would incorporate a more social constructivist model in my classroom. Starting with the premise that math is a language, I plan to use inquiry-based learning, indigenous ways of knowing, collaborative projects, and assessments incorporating creative and critical thinking to devlop students’ competencies and understandings. If components of content act as vehicles to scaffold learning rather than structure it, students have more flexibility to explore topics in math that interest them. By working collaboratively, I would argue with the research of Vygotsky and Piaget behind me, that students learn more effectively. The rate at which I would present material would be tailored to the progress of the class, not the size of a textbook. This ensures content stays within their zone of proximal development. Without the race against time to cover enormous contents, students have the chance to internalize and reflect on their learning as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claims that physics and math can only be taught through a single medium and can only be learned by specific people are both fallacies. Universities and high school administration are struggling to determine why the disciplines of math and physics are so heavily dominated by white economically stable men. I believe it is because these fields do not accommodate multiliteracies. Only the most privileged and economically stable individuals skilled at responding to standardized exams are able to survive high attrition rates of physics and math programs. Students responsible for caring for family, those who work, and those who cant effectively demonstrate their knowledge through prescribed standardized exams statistically do not graduate. Only a specific demographic of people can accumulate the advantages needed to get through their programs, and proceed to employ the same teaching strategies on the next generation of students. Of all the science teachers I asked at Esquimalt, none of them knew how to incorporate indigenous ways of knowing into their classrooms. The teacher who sparked my idea for this post effectively said that math is by nature not an indigenous creation and therefore was not eligible to be indigenized. Those who have survived the high attrition rate of that particular Pre-Calculus 12 course already fit the alarming demographic that composes our universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/352ass1/i.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;375px&quot; /&gt;
I now introduce myself as a “theoretical linguist” because I don’t want to be associated with the inaccessible fields that are physics and math. By addressing the way physics and math are taught, and modernizing them to account for multiliteracies, I believe much of the discrimination and elitism endemic to these fields would disappear. It is time for teachers in this field to Ted Aokis view that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“education is not a journey, rather to be educated means to travel with a different view”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main understandings I have derived from this reflection activity. Firstly, teaching physics and math as languages is a technique much more conducive to integrating multiliteracies methodologies. Math is more than a collection of rules, and just like any language can be manipulated for artistic purposes. Secondly, integrating a multiliteracies methodology could have the effect of enhancing the learning experience for students. A more diverse demographic of students is likely to participate in a class that allows many modes of expression, collaboration, and creative inquiry-based assessment. Thirdly, and most importantly, integrating a more holistic teaching style within classrooms will help dissolve institutionalized elitism and discrimination which have ultimately always defined the fields of physics and math. Students empowered to use math to tell stories, to model their cultural traditions, and to otherwise communicate will be amazing scientists. Making these fields accessible to a demographic of people previously barred from research, academia may be exposed to perspectives never before considered. Math and physics require creativity, otherwise they would never change. I look forward to meeting theoretical linguists like myself who also want to change the way we interact with math as a society.&lt;/p&gt;

This post includes the first measurements of trees from Konuckson Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-park&quot;&gt;The Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/inquiry2/wow.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;335px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;where&quot;&gt;Where?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konuckson Park is located in the center of ten-mile point in Saanich, 10 minutes south of the university by bike. It is a walk away from Cadboro bay and is worth the hike because I believe it contains one of the largest Cottonwoods on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;when&quot;&gt;When?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cant for the life of me find any historical documents about the park or its previous uses. Even the Saanich Parks website doesn’t have an article about Konuckson. I resort to Provincial GIS layers to try and infer what the history of the area is. It likely isn’t accurate, but all I’m trying to do is guess where the biggest trees are so. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above is a city zoning map found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/archives/collections-research.html&quot;&gt;the Saanich archives.&lt;/a&gt; It depicts the city subdivisions as cut in the year 1948. The entirety of what is now Konuckson park lies over the block of lots between Phylis, Bedford, Tudor and Minnie. These roads’ names have since changed, but what doesn’t make sense to me is where these subdivisions went. There are something like 50 lots here which somehow have become a park. More digging using government layers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.gov.bc.ca/ess/hm/imap4m/&quot;&gt;imapsBC&lt;/a&gt; reveals only about 10 of those original lots (the blocks south and north of the semi-circular lot 5) were turned into park. Since this was once private land, I did not expect to find anything old or big since settler landowners were privy to logging and clearing lots for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/inquiry2/Arb1.JPG&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;334px&quot; /&gt;
As a curious tangent, I also found an interesting layer shaded light green below through imapsBC. The dark green areas are parks with the biggest one in the center being Konuckson. The light green patches overlap privately owned lots but are nevertheless marked “Registered and Recognized historic places”. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/a8d72ad9-2379-4d6d-9ff7-f3d0527dfb80&quot;&gt;government data catalogue&lt;/a&gt; describes this layer as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Historic Environment Spatial Layer contains polygons and related attributes representing post-1846 historic places in British Columbia that are recorded on the provincial heritage register. It does not include any archaeological site information.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/inquiry2/wow2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 1&quot; /&gt;
Some of them actually are archaological sites, but this isn’t the place to talk about that. Most of them are “historic residences”. Other than that, its seems what were “roads” through the park no longer exist. I guess houses were never built on the Konuckson blocks, and the land in some places may be mostly undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/inquiry2/Doug2.JPG&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;340px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;who&quot;&gt;Who?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the way the park has been zoned historically, I expect the land management of this area to have been dominated by settlers throughout the lifespans of any trees that now live there. I know in some places, indigenous groups maintain gardens and spiritual trails to this day. I don’t know if that would be the case here considering the circumstances, but I will tread lightly. It is in a very convenient location close to Cadboro bay, and its beyond question that the area was used extensively by groups here prior to settler arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settlers may have modified the land by clearing, burning, or introducing new species, pests and diseases into the native ecosystem here. This wouldn’t really be conducive to saving large trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees in parks generally aren’t cut down after they become parks. Its good reason to suspect that larger undisturbed areas might be found there. Also, the topographical shape of Konuckson is kind of like a bowl. It collects water, and the center of the park is quite wet; conducive to growing Cedar and Cottonwood. This is definitely an area to scout around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-found&quot;&gt;What we Found&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/inquiry2/Cotton1.JPG&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;340px&quot; /&gt;
Konuckson has many trails covering the entire park. Its hard to get lost if you know which way you want to walk. Some of the trails look maintained by the city. Others look like they were made by deer or people infrequently walking by. I don’t know what the indigenous relationship with the area is, but my girlfriend pointed out Rattlesnake everywhere in one particular area. There was a large boulder, a semi-circle of smaller boulders, and some older Arbutus. Perfect place for a campfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest treee was easily the biggest Cottonwood I’ve ever seen right in the middle of the park where its the wettest. There are two Arbutus in one region that are about a meter across as well. The locations and measurements that we took are shown in the map below. Go check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-stigma-and-technology-in-classrooms&quot;&gt;Social Stigma and Technology in Classrooms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, marijuana was a highly “controlled” substance in Canada. Simple posession of the plant could land you in jail with a criminal record. Despite this, millions of Canadians still took the risks of using the plant, cultivating it, and selling it. There are reasons for taking this risk. Marijuana has been shown to help treat chronic pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, nausea, and anorexia.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is also research to suggest that weed can enhance creativity for some people.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question emerges, if the substance was so widely used, and had proven benefits in certain cases, why was the interaction with this plant so taboo? Does this stigma still exist after legalization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my time in high school, a war was waged against technology in the classroom. I have observed that instead of using technology to their advantage, many teachers, especially those taught industrial models of education, treat phones and computers like digital narcotics. The environment created for me and my peers in high school was not conducive to technological literacy. Instead, teachers would confiscate our property, even going so far as to break them in one case I experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/student1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;student1&quot; /&gt;
The archtype of “gamers” and other derivatives of tech culture carry the the social stigma regarding techonology; that it destroys creativity and makes you anti-social. Similarly, the ‘stoner’ archtype of the cannabis user propagates the artificial narrative that weed makes individuals lazy, less productive, or less creative. Neither of these stereotypes have any basis in truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This narrow-mindedness towards the opportunities that techology presents is similar to Canadas war on weed. Instead of researching the potential of the plant, it was outlawed. 
The time has come to embrace technology in the classroom. Most students own smartphones and computers. Most of them carry their techonology on their person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prohibit something only creates uneeded division in any group. To prohibit a behaviour, such as the use of technology, divides a class into those who use phones and those who dont. A result of any division is alienation; being an outsider to a group.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As Henri Tajfel theorized in his social identity theory, simple divisions into in-groups and out-groups are the basis of prejudice.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since this necessarily occurs when a teacher restricts the use of technology, some consequences could be that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/segregation1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alientated students refuse to participate in class.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students are restricted from mode of communication they could effectively use to demonstrate understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students fight with the teacher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students fight amongst each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-technology-in-the-classroom&quot;&gt;Benefits of technology in the Classroom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why then should we decriminalize technology in the classroom? As the EDCI 336 speaker said this week, students are going to use their phones in class regardless of what you do. Why not use them to your advantage as a teacher? Furthermore, technology influences every aspect of life now from job seeking to picking up your groceries. To not teach students the benefits an pitfalls of technology would be doing them a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, some people just use technology as their primary mode of communication. This fact should not be construed as a disorder but rather a utilization of available tools. The progress of research as a species has produced a new set of tools that our parents never had, and hence, a generational gap. This occurred with the advent of the printing press, again with telephones, automobiles etc., Vsauce has a good video discussing how technology creates generational gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LD0x7ho_IYc&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tech literacy is real, and teachers need to account for students who use technology as a means of communicating. Many apps and programs can help complex learners demonstrate their understanding of a subject in a way that has never been possible before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As platforms, many social media outlets facilitate a level personal expression that students might be uncomfortable exercising in person. Showcasing art, projects, and other work can be done in an ethically responsible way through the internet. These platforms also have the power to connect otherwise disparate groups of people which can have both positive and negative consequences, but for the sake of this argument, it can help facilitate discussions between students which otherwise might not have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is also the largest source of information humans have ever had immediate access to. Although this fact, and the way it is employed is also a double-edged sword, the efficiency with which students can now learn basic concepts through the use of the internet is reall a force to be harnessed. Take for example math. Many practice problems for any high school unit are available and are a google search away. Step-by-step instructions are available to help those who need the extra hand. Although this would seem to render the role of a teacher useless, it takes one to teach students how to use these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pitfalls-of-technology-in-the-classroom&quot;&gt;Pitfalls of Technology in the Classroom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extend the analogy made at the beginning of this post slightly further, just like weed, technology can be addicting.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, like anything addictive, excess use can be detrimental leading even to dependancy. I have spent this time arguing that technology has its place in classrooms, but I don’t believe that its role should extend beyond that of a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overuse of technology can restrict learning in many ways. The most obvious way is that students might not pay attention in class. Although there can be many reasons why a student might refuse to pay attention to a teacher, texting a friend or playing a game are definitely two of them. Generally, I don’t think teachers are entitled to the attention of their students. I think teachers need to convince their audience that what they say has both meaning and relevance. Failure to capture the attention of students could be a result of a generational gap, or simply a breakdown in communication, but if the majority of students are playing on their phones during class, it probably means the material being taught doesn’t resonate with them in a meaningful way. Its the job of the teacher to fix this problem rather than condemn a symptom of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addiction to technology can complicate its role as a tool. Earlier the value of social media was pointed out. The pitfalls of social media, especially in the event of an addiction should now be summarized. The concept of an echo chamber emerges by segregating communities based on political, social or any other preferences. As stated before, social identity theory suggests that divisions between individuals necessitates prejudice. In this sense, many social media platforms have actually become the roots for racism and a host of other social problems, despite simultaneously uniting social justice groups. Social media platforms also open another platform for bullying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/epistemology1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;340xpx&quot; /&gt;
Technology, if used incorrectly can miseducate students. A whole host of falsities exist on the internet, some of which are maliciouly and intentionally propagated to the student audience. This is why teaching tech literacy necessarily means teaching critical thinking. The ancient episdemological question; “what do we know, and how do we know it?” is very relevant here. To use the internet efficiently, students need to be taught&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to process data and information,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to effectively search for what they are looking for,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to spot misinformation,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to weigh conflicting sources,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to identify their own ways of knowing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to take what they have learned and construct their own balanced opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these critical aspects of tech literacy can be learned overnight, but this fact reinforces the reasons why we need to bring technology into the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

A rough summary of project procedure and preliminary knowledge about local trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tree-search-details&quot;&gt;Tree Search Details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “discovery” has been applied to many advancements by settlers in BC through history. To be clear, this is a personal project intended to collect and compile resources regarding interesting trees on the Saanich peninsula. I’ve only lived in this region for a few months, and I believe this project is a good excuse to learn about the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a comprehensive search for cool trees around Victoria begins, I have to specify some details about the search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the relevance of this project?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we define a “big”, “old”, “gnarly” or otherwise “interesting” tree?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What measurements should be performed on trees found?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which areas will be searched?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-point&quot;&gt;What is the Point?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this project, I hope to develop a catalogue of “big”, “old”, “gnarly” or otherwise “interesting” trees. This catalogue will contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exact tree locations (Lat., Long.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify each tree’ species&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reference to species-specific entry in “Trees of BC” section of this blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average dimensions (circumference, height)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pictures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this officially does nothing more than satisfy a personal curiosity, since all of this information has already been compiled by the municipalities of the region, even if it is not public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-trees-should-be-included-in-search&quot;&gt;Which trees should be included in Search?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking down the street or through a park, there are trees everywhere. In order to make this project more concrete, I need operational definitions of “big”, “old”, or “gnarly”. Any combination of these adjectives constitues an “interesting” tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;trees-of-bc&quot;&gt;Trees of BC&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I want to restrict this project mostly to trees native to BC. This excludes many large trees in residential areas despite their size, but simplifies the project dramatically. I have included a list and summaries of the species I will be investigating under the tab “Trees of BC”. I hope to eventually compile a well-rounded list of resources to populate the entry for each species in that section. I will start by quoting the popular “Plants of Coastal British Columbia”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By species, this project will investigate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Western Hemlock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grand Fir&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Douglas Fir&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sitka Spruce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pines (Lodgepole, Ponderosa, Jeffrey, Monterey)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pacific Yew&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Cedar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yellow Cedar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Alder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bigleaf Maple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Black Cottonwood&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giant Sequoia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redwood Sequoia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arbutus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garry Oak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dogwood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;big-trees&quot;&gt;“Big” Trees&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big tree will be visually distinct with respect to other trees either in height or width. For conifers, I will set the “width” threshold for consideration in my index to be “easily more than my wingspan in diameter” which is approximately 175 cm. If a tree is found that roughly meets this criteria, its circumference will be measured by tape. For simplicity, I will just add every tree that I go to the trouble of measuring. To measure height, a sextant will be used. This is a device that measures angle. By measuring the angle between the horizontal and the top of the tree and recording some distances, you can roughly determine the tree height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its harder to set a standard working definition of “big” for deciduous trees. I’m mostly going to focus on conifers anyway, but will visit most of the municipally recorded “significant” trees close to my location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;old-trees&quot;&gt;“Old” Trees&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Old tree is defined as a tree that germinated before settlers would have logged an area. Note that traditional land management could account for the clearing of land. For the sake of this project, I’ll set the “old” threshold to be 250 years old - the way old growth is defined by the government. It is hard to determine the age of a tree. You need an increment bore to do it accurately. Some day I mmight buy one, but for the sake of this project, I will infer tree age from their diameter and the growth rates of trees of the same species. A felled tree can be measured for their average growth rate. I will therefore have to keep eyes out for dead trees with discernable ring structures to get a good estimate of the average growth rates for species in an area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;gnarly-trees&quot;&gt;“Gnarly” Trees&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Gnarly&lt;/strong&gt; tree is one that looks lit like these californian Bristlecone Pines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/bristlecone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bristlecone Pine.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-are-the-trees&quot;&gt;Where are the trees?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, very comprehensive lists of “significant” trees have already been compiled in the municipalities of Victoria and Saanich. Since these are the regions closest to me, it is here that I will search for cool trees. For the sake of completeness, I will compile these municipal resources here. Through Saanich’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/natural-environment/trees/significant-tree-program.html&quot;&gt;significant tree program,&lt;/a&gt; we have a valuable list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saanich.ca/assets/Community/Documents/ScheduleB-Significant-Trees.pdf&quot;&gt;Schedule “B” to tree preservation bylaw, 2014 No. 9272.&lt;/a&gt; This list gives accurate directions to these trees as well as descriptions, and rough dimensions. They do not incrude their exact Lat. and Long. coordinates or accurate measurements. It is a rough list of some 150 trees of significance in the Saanich area. This resource is a valuable starting point for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/VicLidar1.png&quot; alt=&quot;viclidar&quot; /&gt;
The Victoria municipality takes this one step further providing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendata.victoria.ca&quot;&gt;entire LIDAR profile&lt;/a&gt; of the city’ tree canopy. An example is shown to the right. Vast data sets regarding the trees within this district are hosted through VicMap.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When I get to looking at the Victoria district, I will try to use this LIDAR data. I should be able to search by specific height to find trees higher than a given threshold. This may be more trouble than it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/UBCBigTree1.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;330px&quot; /&gt;
The Highlands municipality has their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.highlands.ca/187/Maps&quot;&gt;Green Map&lt;/a&gt; also detailing rough locations of interesting flora. I don’t know if I will be able to travel over there however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigtrees.forestry.ubc.ca/bc-bigtree-registry/&quot;&gt;BC big tree registry&lt;/a&gt; lists the largest known trees in BC. A couple of which are on the Saanich peninsula. This list will be consulted when exploring outside of the GVA. A snapshot of the list is shown here. Other than these resources, I hope to consult with traditional knowledge holders and experts, the raw LIDAR data, and directed hiking to find other trees to add to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-significant-trees&quot;&gt;Summary of Significant Trees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This table is a summary of the known trees than I’d like to visit. It is compiled from open datasets provided from local municipalities as well as the UBC big tree registry. I know for fact that this list is not exhaustive and have personally found trees not mentioned on this list of comparable and in some cases larger size.&lt;/p&gt;

This post is an outline of the free-inquiry project I will complete for EDCI 336.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trees-of-victoria&quot;&gt;Trees of Victoria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided to dedicate my free inquiry project to recording the size and locations of all the large or otherwise notable trees in the greater Victoria area (GVA). With help from the UBC Big Tree registry, GPS and GIS software, LIDAR (mapping technology), some basic measurement equipment, a camera and extensive hiking, I hope to reveal interesting dendrological specimens that grow around the Saanich peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/WhaleLog.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;
I love discovering weird trees, especially those in urban places. I have wanted to start this project for some time but have lacked a medium through which I could record and document my procedure and findings. I believe this assignment for EDCI 336 is the perfect excuse to get moving. This blog will provide the perfect platform to summarize my notes and procedure for exhaustively searching the entire GVA for “cool” trees. It is also ideal for combining and presenting mixed media. As such, my notes, photos, maps and graphs can all be presented in a single post to best reflect an adventure or finding from a given day. The blog format is linear and simple which also serves as a useful educational tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazy trees can be found where you would least expect them. My friend Jaden and I once found a Douglas Fir 2m in diameter (which is bigger than it sounds) right in our neighbourhood of Queens park. We had grown up our entire lives around this tree and always known of its presence, but we had never stopped and dedicated the entirety of our though to admiring the existence of this tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/Woodlot1.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;
I’ve never taken a biology course in my life, but as I spend more time around trees and allow their presence to just occupy my mind, the more my respect for the field deepens. Trees are amazing. Take it from me - a physicist who used to think that anything termed “organism” could be modelled by a spherical body of water in a vaccuum. We cannot live without them, and neither can the rest of our planet. As my appreciation for trees has grown, I have picked up on their language - small details I would never have noticed before. They make different sounds, smells and colours in different conditions, even within the same species. Fairly &lt;a href=&quot;https://suzannesimard.com/research/&quot;&gt;novel research&lt;/a&gt; by my hero Susanne Simard at UBC confirms that in many ways, trees do communicate. Forester Peter Wohlleben characterizes this research best in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Life-Trees-Communicate_Discoveries-Secret/dp/1771642483/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=hidden+life+of+trees&amp;amp;qid=1632378107&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidden Life of Trees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Notably in our remaining old growth forests here in BC,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“the root systems of neighbouring trees inevitably intersect and grow into one another [and] usually there are fungi present that act as intermediaries to guarantee quick dissemination of … news. These fungi operate like fiber optic cables … fungal connections transmit signals from one tree to the next, helping trees exchange news about insects, drought, and other dangers. Science has adopted a term first coined by the journal &lt;em&gt;NATURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for Dr. Simard’s discovery of the ‘wood wide web’ pervading our forests”(10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-outline&quot;&gt;Project Outline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, I want to systematically explore the entire GVA for interesting, gnarly, old or big trees on my mind. Obviously, it would help to have a guide of where to look for cool trees in order to expediate the search. Here I identify 3 main sources that might hint to where I will find them. This assignment is intended to focus on learning new skills; specifically those relating to tech literacy and education. I have chosen these three information systems specifically because I am not knowledgable in their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/Langdale.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Lagdale1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;consultation-with-experts-and-indigenous-knowledge-holders&quot;&gt;Consultation with Experts and Indigenous knowledge Holders&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, in a search to find interesting trees it would help to get in touch with those who study interesting trees, or else people who have lived around such trees since time immemorial. Although this consultation does not rely heavily on tech literacy outside email and other electronic communications, I believe that what I learn can be presented over a technological platform such as this blog. This blog allows for many modalities of knowledge to be presented. I will therefore summarize my learning with experts through my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;physical-exploration&quot;&gt;Physical Exploration&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find interesting trees, it will be crucial to physically search for them. Technology can be used to organize and expediate this process to avoid repeatedly searching particular places. It can be tricky to navigate the large forested parks in Victoria, so I will use the mapping features of either my phone or a dedicated GPS device to track my progress. My physical progress of sweeping the city will be summarized graphically on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;global-information-systems-gis-and-other-software&quot;&gt;Global Information Systems (GIS) and Other Software&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across public light detection and ranging (LIDAR)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; data for Stanley park&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as collected by the Vancouver Parks board. The authors of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vancouversbigtrees.com/stanley-park/&quot;&gt;Vancouver Big Tree Hiking Guide&lt;/a&gt; then inspired me to consider using LIDAR to search for interesting trees. LIDAR paints a picture of the topography of a forest. It paints a 3D profile of a birds-eye-view. By subtracting out public data about the altitude of the ground, you can produce heatmaps that reveal where the tallest trees in a forest are located. An example of this is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/StanleyParkLidar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig. 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am entirely unfamiliar with the software used to produce this plot, but its usefulness in this project cannot be understated. I have therefore decided to use this assignment as an excuse to learn ArcGIS; the software responsible for processing LIDAR data. Hopefully I will be able to create dendrological treasure maps pointing to the tall trees of Victoria. ArcGIS is installed on one computer for public use in the UVic library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-inquiry-project-criteria&quot;&gt;Free-Inquiry Project Criteria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since trees and the sciences that describe them frequently occupy my mind, I believe this project adequately fits the criteria for this assignment; “a project to learn about something you are passionate or curious about.” Since “the purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use technology throughout the learning process, from finding resources and people, to documenting, curating, and reflecting on your learning”, through the use of this blog, open-source GIS software and LIDAR data, MATLAB, the creative commons and other online materials, I will demonstrate this learning outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;iste-student-learning-outcomes&quot;&gt;ISTE Student Learning Outcomes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assignment is set to address points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards-for-students&quot;&gt;ISTE learning outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. I have them listed here for my own reflection to refer back to when writing posts and updates to this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowered Learner:&lt;/strong&gt; Students leverage technology to take an active role in choosing, achieving, and demonstrating competency in their learning goals, informed by the learning sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Citizen:&lt;/strong&gt; Students recognize the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of living, learning and working in an interconnected digital world, and they act and model in ways that are safe, legal and ethical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Constructor:&lt;/strong&gt; Students critically curate a variety of resources using digital tools to construct knowledge, produce creative artifacts and make meaningful learning experiences for themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Designer:&lt;/strong&gt; Students use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new, useful or imaginative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favourite-open-sources-of-information&quot;&gt;Favourite Open Sources of Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate reflections about this week center around my two favourite open sources of educational material - Wikipedia and the Creative Commons. Both have pros and cons, but I will be using both in my own future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;wikipedia&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;; the free encyclopedia has a bad reputation for not being accurate. Although its true in some cases, all sources of information, including peer-reviewed journals are subject to inaccuracies once in a while. I believe the strength of wikipedia is its ability to compile useful information. In published articles that have been reviewed, most claims are cited, providing a long list of shortcuts to potentially very reputable sources. Wikipdeia is also powered by the Creative Commons, and the many forms of information embedded in articles (images, gifs, videos) compliment the acticles themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;creative-commons&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; is a hub for open-access media. It is a public databas of content free from many copyright legislation. This database is useful in education because it can be embedded and cited freely when building your own resources. Many works can also be manipulated and adjusted and republished. I hope to eventually register some of the work on this blog in the Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="content" /><category term="demo" /><summary type="html">Reflection on the use of open-source educational material online.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Tree Inquiry - PSII Inquiry Tools</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/content/demo/2021/09/23/PSIIInquiryTools/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Tree Inquiry - PSII Inquiry Tools" /><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-09-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/content/demo/2021/09/23/PSIIInquiryTools</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/content/demo/2021/09/23/PSIIInquiryTools/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/image/PSIItools.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lagdale1&quot; /&gt;
An outline of the PSII inquiry steps applied in a walk through a local park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-psii-inquiry-steps&quot;&gt;The PSII Inquiry Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry has determined &lt;a href=&quot;https://learningstorm.org/inquiry-tools/&quot;&gt;steps for competency assessment&lt;/a&gt;. These steps are presented graphically below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting&lt;/strong&gt;: Learner creates/co-creates a question or questions that are of a kind that will allow an inquiry or a quest to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepening&lt;/strong&gt;: Learner takes on early research based on starting questions. May discuss with teacher and/or other learners to help flesh out ideas. Research may involve creating something or doing something besides just reading or talking. The goal is to improve the quality of the question(s) from Step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refining&lt;/strong&gt;: Learner creates new questions based on research and learning in Step 2. These could be expressed in a mind map (to show how learner got there), or just a new list of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;: Learner develops and plans learning activities, projects, sessions, experiences, etc. to address/explore new questions from Step 3, including timelines, assessment ideas, and resource needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Learner follows plans from Step 4, making modifications as needed. Daily and weekly work plans will reflect short-term goals. Assessment of learning will take place throughout this step. Reflection on learning is also part of this step.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inquiry-steps-applied-to-tree-project&quot;&gt;Inquiry Steps Applied to Tree Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting&lt;/strong&gt;: I begin with the questions: “What is the biggest tree in Konuckson park?”, and “How will I find it?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepening&lt;/strong&gt;: I can increase my knowledge of Konuckson Park by contacting knowledge holders or finding resources regarding the history of the park. I can learn about the trees from literature. I can use GIS to hint at probable locations of trees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refining&lt;/strong&gt;: After some research, I now wonder: “What is the history of Konuckson Park?”, “Was the area ever cleared or human-managed?”, “How would this affect the history of the trees?”, “Where is the most probable location of a large tree?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;: I then commit to physically exploring the partsof Konuckson park which I think would be the most likely to have large trees. Since it was a wet area, I suspect to be looking for large Cottonwoods or Cedars. The timeline and notes are recorded in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: After extensive searching, large trees were found. I now wonder if my research and explorations were exhaustive enough to merit moving on to a new area. I decide, my search was indeed exhaustive and continue to researching a new area (Phyllis Park). I can take what I learned from this cycle of the inquiry steps forward into future planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

This is my first official post on this blog. I have created it as part of the EDCI 336 class at UVic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hello-world&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have constructed this website from a template I found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/forever-jekyll/forever-jekyll&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; using Jekyll. I don’t take credit for writing a lot of the skeleton of the website, but I’ll credit the actual authors and software developpers in the footers once I finish the skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-me&quot;&gt;About Me&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love trees, photography, physics and education. I believe this blog will be a good place to share these interests as well as complete the objectives for my EDCI 336 class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have opted to not use Wordpress as the platform for this project because I dont know how they handle data. I also don’t want to have to pay for my website. I hopefully will be able to use this site to host my CV, research, and cool projects in the future, so I wanted to really put the time into making something that I can own and completely control for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be sharing quite a bit of my photography. I put a lot of thought into my pictures, and they’re a good demonstration of how art and science are two sides of the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my photos relate to the natural world. Growing up in British Columbia, its difficult not to be connected to our enormous forests. I’m also really interested in climate science and modelling. Hopefully this will be a platform where I can share some ameteur studies that I’ve been planning to do for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ll beat out the last few bugs on this website and hopefully it’ll be all smooth sailing from there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="content" /><category term="demo" /><summary type="html">This is my first official post on this blog.

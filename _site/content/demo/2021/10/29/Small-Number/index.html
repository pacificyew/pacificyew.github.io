<h3 id="mathcatcher">Mathcatcher</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/mathcatcher.html">Mathcatcher</a> is a math education program developped by a team of engaged professors at SFU. The motivation behind the program is to engage a wide demographic of students through indigenous storytelling. The programm does outreach and workshops at schools around Canada and has succeeded in constructing a network of math and indigenous language educators around the counrty.</p>

<h3 id="my-involvement-with-mathcatcher">My Involvement with Mathcatcher</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/smallnumber/logo.png" align="right" width="340xpx" />
I am currently a research assistant for the Math department at SFU under Dr. Veselin Jungic. Veselin is effectively the father of the project and he is responsible for organizing pretty much everything. I am responsible for editing and directing the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/mathcatcher/StoriesMovies.html">Mathcatcher videos</a>. In particular, I have been working on the project since the beginning of this year and have produced all of the French, Spanish, a Gitxsan and a few Wet’suwet’en videos.</p>

<h3 id="video-editing">Video Editing</h3>

<p>I haven’t been posting as often as usual due to having to deal with ICBC and finding a new car which has occupied all my time. I have also been working on this exact project, so I decided that I would use it as a blog post and stone two birds at once. I employ Adobe Premiere to edit these videos and it has taken me a few years of hobby video-editing projects to get to this point. My editing involved layered masking in some circumstances to include translated titles while still preserving the original art of the video.</p>

<p>These skills can be applicable in the context of a high school classroom for example in the context of animations. In my own subject area of physics, kinematics and movemeent can be a tricky subject to teach. By demonstrating how to stop-motion animate objects moving around a screen or magazine cutouts moving around a page, students can visualize exactly what acceleration, velocity and displacement mean. To move an object you simply displace it to the desired location. To model velocity, you move the object one unit of distance every frame (or every camera exposure). For higher velocities, you can move the object larger units per frame. To model acceleration, you slowly increase or decrease the distance the object travels each frame.</p>

<p>I wanted to include an example of this old-fasshioned animating style, but unfortunately I don’t have time or space to set up my lab. In the future I might be able to post a sample. I need to find a way to embed locally hosted videos on this website first since I don’t really want to upload any of my personal work to youtube or vimeo. I feel this work is relevant to the topics of graphic design and editing that we were talking about a few weeks ago. An example of one of the videos I have helped to reate is shown below.</p>

<div class="vimeo-wrapper">

</div>

<h3 id="audio-editing">Audio Editing</h3>

<p>Audio editing is also involved since some videos include soundscapes, some of which I record myself. For one video, I needed audio of a fish jumping out of the water. Since at the time I was living on Gambier island, I was able to go down to whispering creek the same day and record a salmon run which was happening at the time.</p>

<p>The most difficult audio to work with is dictation. Since most of the videos I am now dealing with are in Gitxsan and Wit’suwit’en, I have to piece together recordings of a language I barely understand. I have to say though after listening to many of these stories hundreds of times, I now have a short vocabulary in these languages.</p>

<h3 id="cross-curricular">Cross-Curricular</h3>

<p>I believe that this project is relevant to the PSII learning philosophies that the speaker outlined a couple weeks ago. In particular, that the Mathcatcher project is cross-curricular. The mathcatcher videos are a language revitalization program which really effectively veil math and logic problems. Each video contains a question at the end that students can take their time to think about. I has been motivated through storytelling, and in that way is also multi-modal. I believe that this project is proof that indigenous worldviews can be integrated into math education.</p>

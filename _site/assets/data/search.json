    "content"  : "\nThis post includes the first measurements of trees from Konuckson Park.\n\nThe Park\n\n\nWhere?\nKonuckson Park is located in the center of ten-mile point in Saanich, 10 minutes south of the university by bike. It is a walk away from Cadboro bay and is worth the hike because I believe it contains one of the largest Cottonwoods on the peninsula.\n\nWhen?\nI cant for the life of me find any historical documents about the park or its previous uses. Even the Saanich Parks website doesn’t have an article about Konuckson. I resort to Provincial GIS layers to try and infer what the history of the area is. It likely isn’t accurate, but all I’m trying to do is guess where the biggest trees are so. Yeah.\n\nWhat?\nThe image above is a city zoning map found on the Saanich archives. It depicts the city subdivisions as cut in the year 1948. The entirety of what is now Konuckson park lies over the block of lots between Phylis, Bedford, Tudor and Minnie. These roads’ names have since changed, but what doesn’t make sense to me is where these subdivisions went. There are something like 50 lots here which somehow have become a park. More digging using government layers on imapsBC reveals only about 10 of those original lots (the blocks south and north of the semi-circular lot 5) were turned into park. Since this was once private land, I did not expect to find anything old or big since settler landowners were privy to logging and clearing lots for agriculture.\n\n\nAs a curious tangent, I also found an interesting layer shaded light green below through imapsBC. The dark green areas are parks with the biggest one in the center being Konuckson. The light green patches overlap privately owned lots but are nevertheless marked “Registered and Recognized historic places”. The government data catalogue describes this layer as:\n\n\n  “The Historic Environment Spatial Layer contains polygons and related attributes representing post-1846 historic places in British Columbia that are recorded on the provincial heritage register. It does not include any archaeological site information.1”\n\n\n\n\nSome of them actually are archaological sites, but this isn’t the place to talk about that. Most of them are “historic residences”. Other than that, its seems what were “roads” through the park no longer exist. I guess houses were never built on the Konuckson blocks, and the land in some places may be mostly undisturbed.\n\n\nWho?\nJudging by the way the park has been zoned historically, I expect the land management of this area to have been dominated by settlers throughout the lifespans of any trees that now live there. I know in some places, indigenous groups maintain gardens and spiritual trails to this day. I don’t know if that would be the case here considering the circumstances, but I will tread lightly. It is in a very convenient location close to Cadboro bay, and its beyond question that the area was used extensively by groups here prior to settler arrival.\n\nSettlers may have modified the land by clearing, burning, or introducing new species, pests and diseases into the native ecosystem here. This wouldn’t really be conducive to saving large trees.\n\nWhy?\nTrees in parks generally aren’t cut down after they become parks. Its good reason to suspect that larger undisturbed areas might be found there. Also, the topographical shape of Konuckson is kind of like a bowl. It collects water, and the center of the park is quite wet; conducive to growing Cedar and Cottonwood. This is definitely an area to scout around.\n\nWhat we Found\n\nKonuckson has many trails covering the entire park. Its hard to get lost if you know which way you want to walk. Some of the trails look maintained by the city. Others look like they were made by deer or people infrequently walking by. I don’t know what the indigenous relationship with the area is, but my girlfriend pointed out Rattlesnake everywhere in one particular area. There was a large boulder, a semi-circle of smaller boulders, and some older Arbutus. Perfect place for a campfire.\n\nThe largest treee was easily the biggest Cottonwood I’ve ever seen right in the middle of the park where its the wettest. There are two Arbutus in one region that are about a meter across as well. The locations and measurements that we took are shown in the map below. Go check them out!\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Theresa McFarland, “Historic Environment Spatial Layer”  2018-05-08 &amp;#8617;\n    \n  \n\n"

    "content"  : "Reflection on the role of technology in education.\n\nSocial Stigma and Technology in Classrooms\n\nFor the longest time, marijuana was a highly “controlled” substance in Canada. Simple posession of the plant could land you in jail with a criminal record. Despite this, millions of Canadians still took the risks of using the plant, cultivating it, and selling it. There are reasons for taking this risk. Marijuana has been shown to help treat chronic pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, nausea, and anorexia.1234 There is also research to suggest that weed can enhance creativity for some people.56\n\nThe question emerges, if the substance was so widely used, and had proven benefits in certain cases, why was the interaction with this plant so taboo? Does this stigma still exist after legalization?\n\nThroughout my time in high school, a war was waged against technology in the classroom. I have observed that instead of using technology to their advantage, many teachers, especially those taught industrial models of education, treat phones and computers like digital narcotics. The environment created for me and my peers in high school was not conducive to technological literacy. Instead, teachers would confiscate our property, even going so far as to break them in one case I experienced.\n\n\nThe archtype of “gamers” and other derivatives of tech culture carry the the social stigma regarding techonology; that it destroys creativity and makes you anti-social. Similarly, the ‘stoner’ archtype of the cannabis user propagates the artificial narrative that weed makes individuals lazy, less productive, or less creative. Neither of these stereotypes have any basis in truth.\n\nThis narrow-mindedness towards the opportunities that techology presents is similar to Canadas war on weed. Instead of researching the potential of the plant, it was outlawed. \nThe time has come to embrace technology in the classroom. Most students own smartphones and computers. Most of them carry their techonology on their person.\n\nTo prohibit something only creates uneeded division in any group. To prohibit a behaviour, such as the use of technology, divides a class into those who use phones and those who dont. A result of any division is alienation; being an outsider to a group.7 As Henri Tajfel theorized in his social identity theory, simple divisions into in-groups and out-groups are the basis of prejudice.8 Since this necessarily occurs when a teacher restricts the use of technology, some consequences could be that:\n\n\n\n  Alientated students refuse to participate in class.\n  Students are restricted from mode of communication they could effectively use to demonstrate understanding.\n  Students fight with the teacher.\n  Students fight amongst each other.\n\n\nBenefits of technology in the Classroom\n\nSo, why then should we decriminalize technology in the classroom? As the EDCI 336 speaker said this week, students are going to use their phones in class regardless of what you do. Why not use them to your advantage as a teacher? Furthermore, technology influences every aspect of life now from job seeking to picking up your groceries. To not teach students the benefits an pitfalls of technology would be doing them a disservice.\n\nIn the digital age, some people just use technology as their primary mode of communication. This fact should not be construed as a disorder but rather a utilization of available tools. The progress of research as a species has produced a new set of tools that our parents never had, and hence, a generational gap. This occurred with the advent of the printing press, again with telephones, automobiles etc., Vsauce has a good video discussing how technology creates generational gaps.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nTech literacy is real, and teachers need to account for students who use technology as a means of communicating. Many apps and programs can help complex learners demonstrate their understanding of a subject in a way that has never been possible before.\n\nAs platforms, many social media outlets facilitate a level personal expression that students might be uncomfortable exercising in person. Showcasing art, projects, and other work can be done in an ethically responsible way through the internet. These platforms also have the power to connect otherwise disparate groups of people which can have both positive and negative consequences, but for the sake of this argument, it can help facilitate discussions between students which otherwise might not have happened.\n\nThe internet is also the largest source of information humans have ever had immediate access to. Although this fact, and the way it is employed is also a double-edged sword, the efficiency with which students can now learn basic concepts through the use of the internet is reall a force to be harnessed. Take for example math. Many practice problems for any high school unit are available and are a google search away. Step-by-step instructions are available to help those who need the extra hand. Although this would seem to render the role of a teacher useless, it takes one to teach students how to use these tools.\n\nPitfalls of Technology in the Classroom\n\nTo extend the analogy made at the beginning of this post slightly further, just like weed, technology can be addicting.9 As a result, like anything addictive, excess use can be detrimental leading even to dependancy. I have spent this time arguing that technology has its place in classrooms, but I don’t believe that its role should extend beyond that of a tool.\n\nOveruse of technology can restrict learning in many ways. The most obvious way is that students might not pay attention in class. Although there can be many reasons why a student might refuse to pay attention to a teacher, texting a friend or playing a game are definitely two of them. Generally, I don’t think teachers are entitled to the attention of their students. I think teachers need to convince their audience that what they say has both meaning and relevance. Failure to capture the attention of students could be a result of a generational gap, or simply a breakdown in communication, but if the majority of students are playing on their phones during class, it probably means the material being taught doesn’t resonate with them in a meaningful way. Its the job of the teacher to fix this problem rather than condemn a symptom of it.\n\nAddiction to technology can complicate its role as a tool. Earlier the value of social media was pointed out. The pitfalls of social media, especially in the event of an addiction should now be summarized. The concept of an echo chamber emerges by segregating communities based on political, social or any other preferences. As stated before, social identity theory suggests that divisions between individuals necessitates prejudice. In this sense, many social media platforms have actually become the roots for racism and a host of other social problems, despite simultaneously uniting social justice groups. Social media platforms also open another platform for bullying.\n\n\nTechnology, if used incorrectly can miseducate students. A whole host of falsities exist on the internet, some of which are maliciouly and intentionally propagated to the student audience. This is why teaching tech literacy necessarily means teaching critical thinking. The ancient episdemological question; “what do we know, and how do we know it?” is very relevant here. To use the internet efficiently, students need to be taught\n\n  how to process data and information,\n  how to effectively search for what they are looking for,\n  how to spot misinformation,\n  how to weigh conflicting sources,\n  how to identify their own ways of knowing\n  how to take what they have learned and construct their own balanced opinion.\n\n\nNone of these critical aspects of tech literacy can be learned overnight, but this fact reinforces the reasons why we need to bring technology into the classroom.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Aggarwal SK, Blinderman CD.

    "content"  : "\nA rough summary of project procedure and preliminary knowledge about local trees.\n\nTree Search Details\n\nThe word “discovery” has been applied to many advancements by settlers in BC through history. To be clear, this is a personal project intended to collect and compile resources regarding interesting trees on the Saanich peninsula. I’ve only lived in this region for a few months, and I believe this project is a good excuse to learn about the region.\n\nBefore a comprehensive search for cool trees around Victoria begins, I have to specify some details about the search.\n\n\n  What is the relevance of this project?\n  How do we define a “big”, “old”, “gnarly” or otherwise “interesting” tree?\n  What measurements should be performed on trees found?\n  Which areas will be searched?\n\n\nWhat is the Point?\n\nThrough this project, I hope to develop a catalogue of “big”, “old”, “gnarly” or otherwise “interesting” trees. This catalogue will contain:\n\n\n  Exact tree locations (Lat., Long.)\n  Identify each tree’ species\n  Reference to species-specific entry in “Trees of BC” section of this blog\n  Average dimensions (circumference, height)\n  Pictures\n\n\nHonestly, this officially does nothing more than satisfy a personal curiosity, since all of this information has already been compiled by the municipalities of the region, even if it is not public.\n\nWhich trees should be included in Search?\n\nWalking down the street or through a park, there are trees everywhere. In order to make this project more concrete, I need operational definitions of “big”, “old”, or “gnarly”. Any combination of these adjectives constitues an “interesting” tree.\n\nTrees of BC\n\nFirstly, I want to restrict this project mostly to trees native to BC. This excludes many large trees in residential areas despite their size, but simplifies the project dramatically. I have included a list and summaries of the species I will be investigating under the tab “Trees of BC”. I hope to eventually compile a well-rounded list of resources to populate the entry for each species in that section. I will start by quoting the popular “Plants of Coastal British Columbia”1\n\nBy species, this project will investigate:\n\n\n  Western Hemlock\n  Grand Fir\n  Douglas Fir\n  Sitka Spruce\n  Pines (Lodgepole, Ponderosa, Jeffrey, Monterey)\n  Pacific Yew\n  Red Cedar\n  Yellow Cedar\n  Red Alder\n  Bigleaf Maple\n  Black Cottonwood\n  Giant Sequoia\n  Redwood Sequoia\n  Arbutus\n  Garry Oak\n  Dogwood\n\n\n“Big” Trees\n\nA big tree will be visually distinct with respect to other trees either in height or width. For conifers, I will set the “width” threshold for consideration in my index to be “easily more than my wingspan in diameter” which is approximately 175 cm. If a tree is found that roughly meets this criteria, its circumference will be measured by tape. For simplicity, I will just add every tree that I go to the trouble of measuring. To measure height, a sextant will be used. This is a device that measures angle. By measuring the angle between the horizontal and the top of the tree and recording some distances, you can roughly determine the tree height.\n\nIts harder to set a standard working definition of “big” for deciduous trees. I’m mostly going to focus on conifers anyway, but will visit most of the municipally recorded “significant” trees close to my location.\n\n“Old” Trees\n\nAn Old tree is defined as a tree that germinated before settlers would have logged an area. Note that traditional land management could account for the clearing of land. For the sake of this project, I’ll set the “old” threshold to be 250 years old - the way old growth is defined by the government. It is hard to determine the age of a tree. You need an increment bore to do it accurately. Some day I mmight buy one, but for the sake of this project, I will infer tree age from their diameter and the growth rates of trees of the same species. A felled tree can be measured for their average growth rate. I will therefore have to keep eyes out for dead trees with discernable ring structures to get a good estimate of the average growth rates for species in an area.\n\n“Gnarly” Trees\n\nA Gnarly tree is one that looks lit like these californian Bristlecone Pines.\n\n\n\nWhere are the trees?\n\nTo be clear, very comprehensive lists of “significant” trees have already been compiled in the municipalities of Victoria and Saanich. Since these are the regions closest to me, it is here that I will search for cool trees. For the sake of completeness, I will compile these municipal resources here. Through Saanich’s significant tree program, we have a valuable list of Schedule “B” to tree preservation bylaw, 2014 No. 9272. This list gives accurate directions to these trees as well as descriptions, and rough dimensions. They do not incrude their exact Lat. and Long. coordinates or accurate measurements. It is a rough list of some 150 trees of significance in the Saanich area. This resource is a valuable starting point for this project.\n\n\nThe Victoria municipality takes this one step further providing an entire LIDAR profile of the city’ tree canopy. An example is shown to the right. Vast data sets regarding the trees within this district are hosted through VicMap.2 When I get to looking at the Victoria district, I will try to use this LIDAR data. I should be able to search by specific height to find trees higher than a given threshold. This may be more trouble than it is worth.\n\n\nThe Highlands municipality has their Green Map also detailing rough locations of interesting flora. I don’t know if I will be able to travel over there however.\n\nThe BC big tree registry lists the largest known trees in BC. A couple of which are on the Saanich peninsula. This list will be consulted when exploring outside of the GVA. A snapshot of the list is shown here. Other than these resources, I hope to consult with traditional knowledge holders and experts, the raw LIDAR data, and directed hiking to find other trees to add to this list.\n\nSummary of Significant Trees\n\nThis table is a summary of the known trees than I’d like to visit. It is compiled from open datasets provided from local municipalities as well as the UBC big tree registry. I know for fact that this list is not exhaustive and have personally found trees not mentioned on this list of comparable and in some cases larger size.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Species\n      Location\n      Diameter (cm)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3501 Cedar Hill Rd.\n      99\n    \n    \n      Pacific Yew\n      6105 Castlrock Rd.\n      104\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1604 Derby Rd.\n      125\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      505 Dumeresq St.\n      98\n    \n    \n      Grand Fir\n      4389 Emily Carr Dr.\n      100\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1951 Ernest Av.\n      130\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      1815 Ferndale Rd.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Sequoia\n      4020 Gordon Head Rd.\n      135\n    \n    \n      Sequoia\n      4024 Gordon Head Rd.\n      156\n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      3875 Haro Rd.\n      132\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3114 Harriet Rd.\n      100\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1261 Hastings St.\n      120\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      3878 Hobbs St.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      3878 Hobbs St.\n      100\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      1029 Holmes St.\n      98\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1721 Jefferson St.\n      127\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4012 Malton Av.\n      123\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1721 Midgard Av.\n      115\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3830 Nancy Hanks St.\n      114\n    \n    \n      Monterey Pine\n      3941 Oakdale Pl.\n      60\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      5271 Old West Saanich Rd.\n      201\n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      6117 Old West Saanich Rd.\n      106\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      2661 Queenswood Dr.\n      113\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      756 Rogers Av.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Jeffrey Pine\n      3700 St. Aidan’s Street\n      90\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      759 Sanctuary Ct.\n      126\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1383 Scoular Pl.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4033 South Valley Dr.\n      156\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4546 Viewmont Av.\n      114\n    \n    \n      Red Cedar\n      4635 West Saanich Rd.\n      250\n    \n    \n      Sequoia\n      4362 Wilkinson Rd.\n      200\n    \n    \n      Cottonwood\n      4450 Wilkinson Rd.\n      134\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      2495 Arbutus Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      2879 Austin Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      1779 Barrie Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3005 Baynes Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      877 Beckwith Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4208 Belvedere Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Bruce Hutchison Park\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Cedar Hill X and Richmond Rds.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4081 Cedar Hill X Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Cedar Hill Golf Course\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1941 Cochrane St\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1660 Feltham Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Bigleaf Maple\n      1931 Ferndale Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      South of 4196 Glanford Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Jeffrey Pine\n      Gordon Head and Ferndale Rds.\n       \n    \n    \n      Bigleaf Maple\n      3870 Hobbs St.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4033-47 Hopesmore Pl.\n       \n    \n    \n      Grand Fir\n      Knockan Hill Park\n       \n    \n    \n      Bigleaf Maples\n      Maynard St. and Cadboro Bay Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Grand Fir\n      3039 McAnally St.\n       \n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      5760 Oldfield Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      5266 Old West Saanich Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      6130 Old West Saanich Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Lodgepole Pine\n      Rithets Bog\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      780 Rogers Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3666 Saanich Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Swan Lake Christmas Hill Sanct.\n       \n    \n    \n      Cottonwood\n      Swan Lake Christmas Hill Sanct.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      Torquay Dr. Ash Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      Tyndall Av. and El Sereno Dr.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oaks\n      1971-1979 Watson St.\n       \n    \n    \n      Sequoias\n      4347 Wilkinson Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      48.411448, -123.32035\n      174\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      48.43766, -123.32986\n      150\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      48.50077, -123.34089\n      129\n    \n    \n      Shore Pine\n      48.43108, -123.41766\n      103\n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      48.51640, -123.40335\n      223\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      MacKinnon, A., et al.

    "content"  : "\nAn outline of the PSII inquiry steps applied in a walk through a local park.\n\nThe PSII Inquiry Steps\n\nThe Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry has determined steps for competency assessment. These steps are presented graphically below.\n\n\n  \n    Starting: Learner creates/co-creates a question or questions that are of a kind that will allow an inquiry or a quest to take place.\n  \n  \n    Deepening: Learner takes on early research based on starting questions. May discuss with teacher and/or other learners to help flesh out ideas. Research may involve creating something or doing something besides just reading or talking. The goal is to improve the quality of the question(s) from Step 1.\n  \n  \n    Refining: Learner creates new questions based on research and learning in Step 2. These could be expressed in a mind map (to show how learner got there), or just a new list of questions.\n  \n  \n    Planning: Learner develops and plans learning activities, projects, sessions, experiences, etc. to address/explore new questions from Step 3, including timelines, assessment ideas, and resource needs.\n  \n  \n    Learning: Learner follows plans from Step 4, making modifications as needed. Daily and weekly work plans will reflect short-term goals. Assessment of learning will take place throughout this step. Reflection on learning is also part of this step.\n  \n\n\nInquiry Steps Applied to Tree Project\n\n\n  \n    Starting: I begin with the questions: “What is the biggest tree in Konuckson park?”, and “How will I find it?”\n  \n  \n    Deepening: I can increase my knowledge of Konuckson Park by contacting knowledge holders or finding resources regarding the history of the park. I can learn about the trees from literature. I can use GIS to hint at probable locations of trees.\n  \n  \n    Refining: After some research, I now wonder: “What is the history of Konuckson Park?”, “Was the area ever cleared or human-managed?”, “How would this affect the history of the trees?”, “Where is the most probable location of a large tree?”\n  \n  \n    Planning: I then commit to physically exploring the partsof Konuckson park which I think would be the most likely to have large trees. Since it was a wet area, I suspect to be looking for large Cottonwoods or Cedars. The timeline and notes are recorded in this blog.\n  \n  \n    Learning: After extensive searching, large trees were found. I now wonder if my research and explorations were exhaustive enough to merit moving on to a new area. I decide, my search was indeed exhaustive and continue to researching a new area (Phyllis Park). I can take what I learned from this cycle of the inquiry steps forward into future planning.\n  \n\n"

    "content"  : "Reflection on the use of open-source educational material online.\n\nFavourite Open Sources of Information\n\nMy immediate reflections about this week center around my two favourite open sources of educational material - Wikipedia and the Creative Commons. Both have pros and cons, but I will be using both in my own future work.\n\nWikipedia\n\nWikipedia; the free encyclopedia has a bad reputation for not being accurate. Although its true in some cases, all sources of information, including peer-reviewed journals are subject to inaccuracies once in a while. I believe the strength of wikipedia is its ability to compile useful information. In published articles that have been reviewed, most claims are cited, providing a long list of shortcuts to potentially very reputable sources. Wikipdeia is also powered by the Creative Commons, and the many forms of information embedded in articles (images, gifs, videos) compliment the acticles themselves.\n\nCreative Commons\n\nThe Creative Commons is a hub for open-access media. It is a public databas of content free from many copyright legislation. This database is useful in education because it can be embedded and cited freely when building your own resources. Many works can also be manipulated and adjusted and republished. I hope to eventually register some of the work on this blog in the Creative Commons.\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post is an outline of the free-inquiry project I will complete for EDCI 336.\n\nTrees of Victoria\n\nI have decided to dedicate my free inquiry project to recording the size and locations of all the large or otherwise notable trees in the greater Victoria area (GVA). With help from the UBC Big Tree registry, GPS and GIS software, LIDAR (mapping technology), some basic measurement equipment, a camera and extensive hiking, I hope to reveal interesting dendrological specimens that grow around the Saanich peninsula.\n\n\nI love discovering weird trees, especially those in urban places. I have wanted to start this project for some time but have lacked a medium through which I could record and document my procedure and findings. I believe this assignment for EDCI 336 is the perfect excuse to get moving. This blog will provide the perfect platform to summarize my notes and procedure for exhaustively searching the entire GVA for “cool” trees. It is also ideal for combining and presenting mixed media. As such, my notes, photos, maps and graphs can all be presented in a single post to best reflect an adventure or finding from a given day. The blog format is linear and simple which also serves as a useful educational tool.\n\nMotivation\n\nCrazy trees can be found where you would least expect them. My friend Jaden and I once found a Douglas Fir 2m in diameter (which is bigger than it sounds) right in our neighbourhood of Queens park. We had grown up our entire lives around this tree and always known of its presence, but we had never stopped and dedicated the entirety of our though to admiring the existence of this tree.\n\n\nI’ve never taken a biology course in my life, but as I spend more time around trees and allow their presence to just occupy my mind, the more my respect for the field deepens. Trees are amazing. Take it from me - a physicist who used to think that anything termed “organism” could be modelled by a spherical body of water in a vaccuum. We cannot live without them, and neither can the rest of our planet. As my appreciation for trees has grown, I have picked up on their language - small details I would never have noticed before. They make different sounds, smells and colours in different conditions, even within the same species. Fairly novel research by my hero Susanne Simard at UBC confirms that in many ways, trees do communicate. Forester Peter Wohlleben characterizes this research best in Hidden Life of Trees.1 Notably in our remaining old growth forests here in BC,\n\n\n  “the root systems of neighbouring trees inevitably intersect and grow into one another [and] usually there are fungi present that act as intermediaries to guarantee quick dissemination of … news. These fungi operate like fiber optic cables … fungal connections transmit signals from one tree to the next, helping trees exchange news about insects, drought, and other dangers. Science has adopted a term first coined by the journal NATURE2 for Dr. Simard’s discovery of the ‘wood wide web’ pervading our forests”(10)\n\n\nProject Outline\n\nIn essence, I want to systematically explore the entire GVA for interesting, gnarly, old or big trees on my mind. Obviously, it would help to have a guide of where to look for cool trees in order to expediate the search. Here I identify 3 main sources that might hint to where I will find them. This assignment is intended to focus on learning new skills; specifically those relating to tech literacy and education. I have chosen these three information systems specifically because I am not knowledgable in their use.\n\n\n\nConsultation with Experts and Indigenous knowledge Holders\n\nObviously, in a search to find interesting trees it would help to get in touch with those who study interesting trees, or else people who have lived around such trees since time immemorial. Although this consultation does not rely heavily on tech literacy outside email and other electronic communications, I believe that what I learn can be presented over a technological platform such as this blog. This blog allows for many modalities of knowledge to be presented. I will therefore summarize my learning with experts through my blog posts.\n\nPhysical Exploration\n\nTo find interesting trees, it will be crucial to physically search for them. Technology can be used to organize and expediate this process to avoid repeatedly searching particular places. It can be tricky to navigate the large forested parks in Victoria, so I will use the mapping features of either my phone or a dedicated GPS device to track my progress. My physical progress of sweeping the city will be summarized graphically on this blog.\n\nGlobal Information Systems (GIS) and Other Software\n\nI recently came across public light detection and ranging (LIDAR)3 data for Stanley park4 as collected by the Vancouver Parks board. The authors of the Vancouver Big Tree Hiking Guide then inspired me to consider using LIDAR to search for interesting trees. LIDAR paints a picture of the topography of a forest. It paints a 3D profile of a birds-eye-view. By subtracting out public data about the altitude of the ground, you can produce heatmaps that reveal where the tallest trees in a forest are located. An example of this is shown below.\n\n\n\nI am entirely unfamiliar with the software used to produce this plot, but its usefulness in this project cannot be understated. I have therefore decided to use this assignment as an excuse to learn ArcGIS; the software responsible for processing LIDAR data. Hopefully I will be able to create dendrological treasure maps pointing to the tall trees of Victoria. ArcGIS is installed on one computer for public use in the UVic library.\n\nFree-Inquiry Project Criteria\n\nSince trees and the sciences that describe them frequently occupy my mind, I believe this project adequately fits the criteria for this assignment; “a project to learn about something you are passionate or curious about.” Since “the purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use technology throughout the learning process, from finding resources and people, to documenting, curating, and reflecting on your learning”, through the use of this blog, open-source GIS software and LIDAR data, MATLAB, the creative commons and other online materials, I will demonstrate this learning outcome.\n\nISTE Student Learning Outcomes\n\nThis assignment is set to address points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the ISTE learning outcomes. I have them listed here for my own reflection to refer back to when writing posts and updates to this project.\n\n\n  \n    Empowered Learner: Students leverage technology to take an active role in choosing, achieving, and demonstrating competency in their learning goals, informed by the learning sciences.\n  \n  \n    Digital Citizen: Students recognize the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of living, learning and working in an interconnected digital world, and they act and model in ways that are safe, legal and ethical.\n  \n  \n    Knowledge Constructor: Students critically curate a variety of resources using digital tools to construct knowledge, produce creative artifacts and make meaningful learning experiences for themselves and others.\n  \n  \n    Innovative Designer: Students use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new, useful or imaginative solutions.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Wohlleben, Peter, et al.

    "content"  : "\nThis is my first official post on this blog. I have created it as part of the EDCI 336 class at UVic.\n\nHello World\n\nI have constructed this website from a template I found on Github using Jekyll. I don’t take credit for writing a lot of the skeleton of the website, but I’ll credit the actual authors and software developpers in the footers once I finish the skeleton.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI love trees, photography, physics and education. I believe this blog will be a good place to share these interests as well as complete the objectives for my EDCI 336 class.\n\nI have opted to not use Wordpress as the platform for this project because I dont know how they handle data. I also don’t want to have to pay for my website. I hopefully will be able to use this site to host my CV, research, and cool projects in the future, so I wanted to really put the time into making something that I can own and completely control for the rest of my life.\n\nI will be sharing quite a bit of my photography. I put a lot of thought into my pictures, and they’re a good demonstration of how art and science are two sides of the same coin.\n\nMost of my photos relate to the natural world. Growing up in British Columbia, its difficult not to be connected to our enormous forests. I’m also really interested in climate science and modelling. Hopefully this will be a platform where I can share some ameteur studies that I’ve been planning to do for a few years.\n\nAnyway, I’ll beat out the last few bugs on this website and hopefully it’ll be all smooth sailing from there.\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post investigates some of the applications of google Earth with one contextualization in the field of Forestry. Google as a company has ethical issues, but is useful as a starting point in many investigations.\n\nDeforestation in BC\n\nWe trust our government to certify registered professional foresters to practice sustainable forestry. Its generally accepted that BC is a very green province that won’t run into a shortage of lumber any time soon. The first resource I would draw the attention of anyone accepting these two fallacies to it Google Earth. Recent satellite imagery of the surface of our planet provides irrefutable evidence of not only deforestation, but massive land alterations in our province.\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nGoogle Earth is a very powerful proprietary tool that can be used to conduct GIS investigations. The data used is not open source, and neither are the programs that allow it to work. All google tools are heavily surveilled by both aggressive data collection routines and analytics databases. However, as it can be seen in this blog, maps integration can be a useful tool when open-source and analytics free methods are too time consuming to employ. Google maps or more ethical alternatives have their place in classrooms because they give a current view of the earth, is quite customizable, and yields lots of data for inquiry. It serves as a good jumping-off point for many GIS-related projects.\n\nThe BC interior\nThe map below shows the BC interior. Most of it at least. As you can see, the clearcuts are not only visible from space but dominate the profile of the visible landscape.\n\n\nAdditionally, each of these cuts, although small from a distance, are quite large upon inspection. The maximum allowable size of a small-scale community woodlot in the BC interior is 400 hectares, but as you can see, large companies are exempt from this rule.\n\n\nThe BC coast\n\nThe map below shows the BC coast. Specifically, the West Coast of Vancouver Island.\n\n\nThe maximum allowable size of a small-scale community woodlot in the BC interior is 200 hectares. Again here, large companies have the right to level enormous areas within designated “Tree-Farm Licenses”.\n\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post sumarizes some of the group work that has been done on the final project for this class. The subject of our presentation is student usage of social media. It can be played here:Your browser does not support the HTML5 Audio element.\n\nThe Social Dilemna\n\nThis project was largely inspired by the documentary ‘The Social Dilemna’ directed by Jeff Orlowski. We watched this documentary as reasearch for our group. The film inspired many of our subsequent discussions. In particular, I was focused on techniques of minimizing students’ use of phones within the classroom and furthermore, whether we should.\n\nTracking Social Media Usage\n\nWe began the exploration by tracking our own social media usage. In the fallout of watching the documentary, most of my groupmates were eager to undergo self-reflections regarding their own behaviour. I don’t have social media, so I chose to adapt this activity to overall screen time on my phone to investigate exactly what it was that I do with my phone time.\n\nMy own usage was around 1 hour of screen time a day. Most of that time spent on the web browser on my phone. It didn’t really surprise me to see that most of that time was actually used on Wikipedia. I have a habit when someone mentions something in passing that I want to know more about, I visit the wikipedia page. I find its an awesome resource of links to academic papers. The articles themselves usually provide a pretty good outline of the subject.\n\nShould Students be Deprived of Social Media?\n\nAs discussed in the podcast, it is surprising to realize that despite knowing the negative impacts of social media, and its cost on our time for relatively little benfit, many people still abuse these outlets. This, we agree is part of the problem; that social media is addictive. This fact plays a large role in a classroom. How can a teacher possibly compete with a program tailor made to abuse psychology to its advantage?\n\nWith any addictive compound, there would be public funding for programs that would host presentations and outline the dangers and health effects for students. This happens today for abuse of drugs that could contain fentanyl. It happens with weed. In the 80s and 90s, the subject was cigarettes. My question is what makes social media so different from these other abuses?\n\nI believe the answer is that those who would be conducting the presentations in the first place, and even the creators of social media themselves are also addicted to what they have created.\n\nHerein lies the Social Dilemna. Is it the teachers role to treat students for dependancy and addiction? Our conclusion awaits in our presentation.\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post presents where I plan to go next with my inquiry project.\n\nLIDAR\n\nI haven’t had the time to invest heavily in learning ArcGIS to interpret real global positioning data. I really want to try to predict the locations of old trees using LIDAR. The data itself looks really cool on heatmaps. I think this prceedure would be most effective in the context of a larger contiguous forest with some more substantial topography. The problem with this project on the Saanich peninsula is that it is very flat and rocky. Most of the trees here are Douglas Firs which all grow to around the same height and Arbutuses cant be seen underneath the foliage from the air. I think this would be especially effective in the context of Gambier island where I’m from.\n\nIndigenous Knowledge\n\nThe other perspective I want to integrate into this project is indigenous knowledge. There is an established protocol for accessing indigenous knowledge which does take time and I believe is outside the scope of this course. I will however be inversting time to contact local nations to learn more about the history of land management in different areas. This will likely require some knowlege of technology in the context of education, since meeting with individuals from the nation will likely require an online presentation. I would want to carefully prepare a slide-deck for such a presentation and would use some of the graphics and animating skills we learned during the PowerPoint lesson.\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post is a reflection regarding accessible learning and the presentation from BCEdAccess.\n\nPhones in the classroom\n\nThe main reflection I had about this presentation is how useful technology can be in the context of accessible education and students with exceptionalities. This topic ties in both with an inquiry project I’m conducting at Esquimalt, as well as the group project I am working on in this class.\n\nAt Esquimalt, I’m investigating assessment methods and how they can be discriminatory. One topic that has come out of that discussion is the role that phones play in classrooms. It is clear that some students are aided greatly if not are dependant on accessible learning software on their devices. Despite this, many teachers prohibit the use of phones or other technologies in their classrooms. This is very clearly a disriminatory practice, and was touched on by our speaker during the question period.\n\nFor my group project, I am researching protocols with how to get students to break their addiction to social media in the class and put down their phones. The scope of this project are the psychological and cultural effects of social media in general.\n\nShould We Take Phones?\n\nMany teachers take phones from students in their classess. In spite of the examples of where phones can be useful mentioned earlier, I do think there is a place for teachers to discourage over-use of phones. Digging deeper into the group assignment of this course had us all critiquing and reflecting on the film ‘The Social Dilemna’. The film doesn’t mention anything groundbreaking that people don’t already generally know, but it does a good job bringing all the effects of social media into one place (except the positive ones). Younger students are overwhelmingly addicted to social media, and I think its fair for them to be aksed to take a break for the short duration of classes. Taking phones should always be handled on a case-by-case basis since students may depend on their phones for reasons other than social media.\n\n"

    "content"  : "This post outlines how some of the content in the EDTech class can be integrated into my Big Tree Inquiry.\n\nDigital Footprint\n\nIt is in my own nature to not want to share my personal work and research, especially when I cant control how that information is further shared. Im torn as to what the role of this blog should be in my life, and I think I want to keep it relatviely private in the sense that I won’t be sharing it with my classes. That being said, it should be at the level that I wouldn’t be scared if the students found it. These ideas circulated during the first presentation in the class in which the speaker outlined how we should shape our digital footprints.\n\nCommunication is Key\n\nCommunication is key in education. I believe that once I have published some of the information, and needless to say, once I have time to put more effort into the project, I might consider opening the blog up as a resource for inquiry projects in my own class. The methods by which I share the blog would probably refelect the techniques in this class.\n\nFor example, lets say I was doing a math lesson on geometry and we were investigating whether old trees or young trees put on more wood every year, I could open up a blog post on the projector as a resource to start the lesson. Google maps could be used to explore an area virtually, and the integrated maps could be used to show where local big trees are. If one was close to the school, we could even go there in person.\n\nWhere learning is online, the maps integration would also be helpful. Students who live in disparate parts of the province could optionally mark their position on an open public map. Hiking trips or tree explorations could be planned etc.\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post is a reflections about my own thoughts on blended learning, in particular asynchronous online learning.\n\nBias Against Online Learning\n\nThis phrase alone prompts groans from most of my peers outside of the education programme. Perhaps this is due to having had stellar in-person lectures throughout our undergrad before COVID hit. When we were forced online and our profs at SFU scrambled to go online, the quality in education tanked immediately. Those who held lectures in person tried to maintain their exact lecture style facing a camera. Those who decided on asynchronous lectures simply recorded the most expensive YoutTube videos I hope ever to pay for. It was these qualities alone that tarnished my own perception of online learning in general, and I think it is important for me to acknowledge this bias in order to learn more about the topic.\n\nMaterials presented in Lecture\n\nThe resources and materials presented in lecture helped me understand that online learning transcends zoom, and that technology in education transcends online learning. For example, one program you touched on only briefly allowed individuals participating in conferences to collaborate on a microscopic level within a macroscopic online context. Avatars could be moved within a GUI and interact with other peers, chose which conferences they wanted to join as well as other functions.\n\nPerks on Online Learning\n\nTHere are definite benfits I can see to online resources for delivering material, especially when teaching in rural communities. For students unable to make it to class, having resources handy to allow them to connect from home or view materials asynchronously is crucial. I think it should be a feature of every class just for reference studying or recalling information. The system for organizing this should be easy to access and organize in a logical way.\n\nWith these perks in mind, I still think that in-person methods of teaching are more effective in many cases. Physical communication and collaboration skills are attributes I value in relationships and younger people who dont have the opportunity to go to school in-person miss out on learning these skills.\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post summarizes the results of scanning the queens park area for big trees.\n\nMeasurement Details\n\nMy friend Jaden and I set out to measure the height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of the trees of Queens park. It should be said that it was dark out, but the light of the moon made it easy enough to see the top branches of the trees thus facilitating the use of our sextant. We took the average of many meausrements from a few angles around the trees.\n\nWe Found Big Trees!\n\nIts surprising to me how big the trees in the park really are. I effectively grew up in the park and never really gave the trees a second glance, but with an eye for it now, I can say the trees are defenitely something to behold. Many of them likely are older than the city and would in my mind qualify as old-growth. Assuming a growth rate of 3 mm every year for cedars (considering the areas is quite wet), some of the trees may exceed 300 years of age. The locations and measurements are shown below:\n\n\n"

    "content"  : "This post is a summary of some of the discussions held during the EdTech activity this week.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nWhat is the purpose of pre-requisites? It is argued that many courses require students to draw upon understandings established in previous courses. Many courses including Math 10 in BC, are required to be taken by students in order to graduate. The argument within these fields is that knowledge and content is foundational, and cannot be learned in a different order.\n\nIn the fields of humaninites and the arts, no such hiearchy of content exists to the extent that it forces students to take some courses and restrict them from taking others. It is also worthy to note that arts and huanities courses outside of a main language stream are not required for students to graduate\n\nAre these Pre-requisites necessary?\n\nIn the context of non-STEM courses, in my experience, no process of discriminating students exists to prohibit students from graduating. Pre-requisites, as we discussed in the activity, are largely a STEM-centered concept. But are these barriers necessary? AS we saw with many of the PSII resources, inquiry-based learning is very useful in STEM. Inquiry-based learning is also by definition cross-curricular. So by pretending that fields in STEM are somehow disparate and disconnected from the others means that students lose out on learning opportunities. By imposing pre-requisites, we also stop students from reaching outside the prescribed content for each class to explore the topics.\n\nFurthermore, pre-requisites prohibit students from accessing certain material which might be within the context of the content they are learning. Pre-requisites also stop many students from learning more about a topic. These facts combined with often discriminatory, unstandardized, arbitrary or weakly communicated assessment schemes usually inhibits education. Our group concluded for these reasons and more that pre-requisites are not necessary in a high-school setting.\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post dives into some of the history of New Westminster because I find it interesting and I believe contextualizes the story of the trees that have survived there.\n\nThe Park\n\nWhere?\n\nAlthough this original project was meant to explore forests around the Saanich peninsula, I had the chance to walk around my hometown of New West a few weeks ago and managed to take some measurements. Queens Park refers both to the neighbourhood in which I grew up and a very large area of land that is a municipal park in New Westminster. New Westminster deserves its own post in this blog just to give context to the neighbourhood.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, its old. Not pre-colonial old, but fairly close to it. The town was formerly the capital of BC, and lies on the traditional territory of the Qiqéyt first nation. More about this later.\n\nI don’t think a more proud stronghold of proud colonial loyalists exists in such strength anywhere else in BC. That includes here in Victoria. New Westers are fanatics about where they live and relish romanticized details of what history they choose to remember. The royal engineer responsible for some of the civil planning in the town, Richard Moodie apparently ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the Crown and of the robe’1. To this end, he succeeded. The descendents of the founders of this town still largely live in New West. I was taught by some of them. Many of the attendees of New Wests Schools will be familiar with cringe-worthy manditory colonial traditions and historical hogwash that plagued our public education. The name of the city was given by Queen Victoria herself for what thats worth. Apparently, she didn’t like the name ‘Queensborough’.\n\nThe city was built on stolen land. It was originally used by the Tsawwassen for processing fish. Ironically, this is still performed today, in a very different context. I know very little about the Tsawwassen and how they used the land I grew up on. At this point, few people do because of the political dominance of settler culture there. The BC governments ‘Geographical Names’ tool lists the region as:\n\n\n  “A place formerly inhabited by First Nations’ people, with no current population or that is usually uninhabited … An ancient Tsawwassen village site known as qiq8 (the Coast Salish spelling in 2005 draft for Tsawwassen Final Agreement), is located on the east bank of the Fraser River under todays Patullo Bridge.”\n\n\nIts safe to say that very little to none of the natural components are traditionally culturally modified. Very few trees in this region are old enough to pre-date settlement by colonial powers which occurred through the early 1800s.\n\nThis is becoming a rant, but I made it a point of this inquiry project to examine the cultures and histories of different regions as a means of predicting where I might find the biggest trees. I swear this does have a purpose.\n\nWhy\n\nNew Westminsters’ strategic placement at the mouth of the fraser gave colonial powers control over the use of this waterway. The city had military intentions with onslaughts of American gold miners threatening the dominion of the Hudsons Bay company (in lieu of the Queen). Until 1980, it hosted the pen; a big stone prison. Next door, you would find a mental asylum for children which I promise, looks just about as horrible as it sounds. These two cheery places as well as the graveyards for their occupants are fittingly on the land originally zoned as the ‘Queens Park’.\n\nAt the mouth of the Fraser, it was also a prime location for a resource extraction port. I was told in elementary school that visiting folks from Victoria nicknamed the town ‘stumpville’ after it was extensively logged clear in the mid 1800s. Probably not a great idea considering the steepness of the hill it was built on and the risk logging poses on landslides, but none have yet happened as far as I know.\n\nNew Westminster was also supposed to be the terminus station for the CPR, which after some money moved around between rich land-owners downtown, came to skip New Westminster entirely. Even the highway 1 which was built in 1964 completely passes by New Westminster to its north. Knowing the attitudes of the people who live there, I can say with confidence that New West has remained a separate municipal entity intentionally. The municipal zoning around Queens park is one of a kind. ‘Heritage’ protection is violent there. The running joke is that there are only two kinds of land in New West; parks and strata.\n\nIt would make sense, considering the towns’ history of resource extraction and culture of development and colonialism would leave little chance of any large trees surviving in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Scott, Laura Elaine (1983).

    "content"  : "\nThis post is a reflection regarding the presentation with Jeff Hopkins.\n\nInquiry\n\nMost subject areas in high school have undergone a transition; students no longer obtain a “literacy”, but “Multiliteracies”. This transition is marked by cross-curricular studies, multi-modal assessment strategies, various forms of expression and other qualities pertaining to global and malleable ways of knowing. Physics and math lag behind most other subjects in terms of this transition. I say this with confidence from the perspective of a physics student who has taken over 100 courses in the subject, and as an observer of current science teachers at Esquimalt. One factor slowing this transition could be that mathematicians and physicists refuse to regard their discipline as a language, or that doing so is somehow an attack on the objectivity of the “truth” communicated in their topics.\n\nThe underlying thesis in education at PSII is inquiry, and I believe inquiry is best facilitated by multiliteracies pedagogy.\n\nEmploying Social Constructivism\n\nAs a multiliteracies teacher, I would incorporate a more social constructivist model in my classroom. Starting with the premise that math is a language, I plan to use inquiry-based learning, indigenous ways of knowing, collaborative projects, and assessments incorporating creative and critical thinking to devlop students’ competencies and understandings. If components of content act as vehicles to scaffold learning rather than structure it, students have more flexibility to explore topics in math that interest them. By working collaboratively, I would argue with the research of Vygotsky and Piaget behind me, that students learn more effectively. The rate at which I would present material would be tailored to the progress of the class, not the size of a textbook. This ensures content stays within their zone of proximal development. Without the race against time to cover enormous contents, students have the chance to internalize and reflect on their learning as well.\n\nNetworking\n\nI took the time to connect with Jeff after his presentation. I shared with him some of these thoughts. It is clear that the push to employ inquiry-based learning in Physics and math is an uphill battle. Jeff gave me his contact so I will be keeping in touch with him as I go through my practica.\n\n"

    "content"  : "&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jekyllreflection/jekyll.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;330px&quot;/&amp;gt;\nThis post I tried to invert the inquiry post from last week. The post is identical to the ‘Website Construction’ post, but with all the markdown script visible. It was actually harder to do than I originally thought, but is worth it to reveal how the language works.\n\nwebsite is no longer in its infancy. This post outlines the process by which I created this blog.\n\n### Homebrew\n\nI don’t really have much coding experience. Most of my data crunching was done in MATLAB in my undergrad. I had a course in Fortran, but those skills dont really translate to useful languages that are actually used today. The most useful thing i learned was navigating my computer using bash. Creating and deleting files, editing documents, and writing programs from the command line.&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jekyllreflection/homebrew.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;230px&quot;/&amp;gt;UNIX based computers do this with a “terminal” program, Windows computers have DOS and whatever they call their command line. This is basically where my knowledge ended before this program. Anyone who is looking at this post for advice, look elsewhere; I basically just banged my head against it for a couple months.[^1]\n\nHomebrew is a free open-source package manager that operates from command line on UNIX-based operating systems. It was created in 2009. I used Homebrew to install jekyll and its dependancies as well as other useful software that I didnt know existed before this. Homebrew installs into /usr/local by default. Hit Cmd + Shift + . to see otherwise hidden folders in Finder. Dont delete any of them for no reason though, apple hid them for a reason. Running\n/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;\n\nin Terminal will install Homebrew. The Homebrew webiste contains analytics data, programs, changelogs etc. Homebrew was necessary for installing Jekyll which is the main compiler for the website. After all the programs necessary for jekyll were installed, I haven’t really used Homebrew much.\n\n### Jekyll[^2]\n\nJekyll is a program that compiles websites. It is written in Ruby by Github founder Tom Preston-Werner. A host of volunteers maintains the software, and its most stable release was 4.2.0 in 2020. Detailed instructions for its installation are on [their website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). If you are running the latest operating systems of MacOS, I think it will probably work as advertised. For the rest of us stuck in late 2015, Jekyll only works with a particular version of Ruby installed (&amp;gt;2.5.0). Newer versions for whatever reason dont like being installed. I had issues with OpenSSH not being the right version. I don’t honestly remember what I did to get everything to install properly but forums are your friend. People with actual modern computers probably won’t have the issues I did since\n\n\n  “Jekyll requires Ruby v2.5.0 or higher. macOS Big Sur 11.x ships with Ruby 2.6.3. Check your Ruby version using ruby -v.”\n\n\nI mostly followed the instructions on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) for the installation. Once set up, define a folder that you want to permanently be the website folder, then hit\n\n$ gem install bundler jekyll\n$ jekyll name-of-new-website\n$ cd name-of-new-website\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\nThe last line here hosts the website locally and updates every time you make a change to it. You can turn off your internet and work on it remotely. To view it in your browser go to localhost:4000.\n\n### Github\n\nNow there needs to be some way to host the website. [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) does this for free as long as you can keep your website to under 1 gb. Github is also open-source software. I have no idea where they get money from but it doesn’t seem to be advertising. Get a Github account and then install git and any other dependancies you might need using Homebrew. What you need to do is clone a folder on your computer to a repository on Github. To get a nice URL for your website like github-username.github.io, create a repository of the same name. Go to the pages section of settings for that repo, and enable Github Pages.\n&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n\n![fsdf](/assets/jekyllreflection/github.png)\n&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\nOk, now there needs to be an easy way of updating the repo straight from your computer where you edit it. You do this by cloning a folder to your repo in terminal. Get the URL of the desired repo by hitting the code button on it page on Github, then in terminal\n$ cd /where-you-want-site\n$ git clone URL-from-Github name-of-website-folder\n\nThen drag and drop the contents of the other website folder into this new one. If permissions are set correctly for you to push straight onto the main branch of the repo then you can submit changes by hitting\n$ cd /where-you-want-site\n$ git add -A\n$ git commit -m &quot;desciption of any changes made&quot;\n$ git push\n\nWait 30 minutes, and Github will be hosting your website at https://github-username.github.io\n\nThe other thing I did to get a jump start on the blog is to populate my empty website with one of the templates listed on [http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/). I used [Forever Jekyll](https://github.com/forever-jekyll/forever-jekyll) as stated in the footer of this website, but this theme has its issues. I’ve definitely had to tailor it to my liking. To populate a repo, you can copy-paste the contents or fork it.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nMost of the personalization I did to the website I ‘ve been doing by trial and error. I’ll make a couple changes to the _includes html files and see what it does. I managed to add the [Trees of BC](https://pacificyew.github.io/TreesofBC) navigation header which works when I host the website locally but now when I let Github Pages compile it.\n\nThis brings me to the main troubleshooting point which is that Github Pages doesn’t do everything that you might want it to. It only hosts static sites, and any plugins you might want to add probably won’t work. If found this out the hard way by creating some really nice maps for my tree project which ended up not working because they required a plugin called leaflet. A complete list of dependancy versions for jekyll compatible with Pages is [found here](https://pages.github.com/versions/). To remedy the problem with the maps, I found that you could really easily make google maps with markers and then link them to a website page as such:\n&amp;lt;iframe \n  width=&quot;720&quot;\n  height=&quot;500&quot;\n  frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;border:0&quot;\n  src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1StAOnbgdOCSCagiKEdqfr10P4phAsUqK&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;\n\n\nThis brings me to another point. Posts for jekyll are written in Markdown which is, for my purposes at least, a simplified version of html. You can take snippets of html (most of which I find by trolling forums) and put them straight into your markdown blog post. For the same of demonstration, an identical post to this one is also posted on the blog. This way, you can see which symbols do what. This post is a good example because I integrate some pictures, manipulate the text alignment, add hyperlinks and mess around with the text a bit.\n\n### Plans for the Future\n\nI want to really personalize this blog because I’m going to use it for a long time. If the [Trees of BC](https://pacificyew.github.io/TreesofBC) wasn’t 404’ed, the information I’ve compiled during my tree project would be visible there. Its actually all written, I just can’t figure out why Pages doesn’t like it. I want a whole other page of posts to be listed on this page with a post for each variety of tree. Having one static website host two separate blogs is quite difficult and I won’t get to it any time soon, but I think it would work really well.\n\nI also want to spice up the visuals a bit. Right now everything is white and boring. I would love cool patterns down the margins on the sides or maybe pictures in the background.\n\n[^1]: Vítor Galvão, Mike McQuaid, Synoli.

    "content"  : "This post summarizes most of the ideas featured in our classes over the last two weeks regarding the creation of resources and working with graphics.\n\n\n\n\nMathcatcher\n\nMathcatcher is a math education program developped by a team of engaged professors at SFU. The motivation behind the program is to engage a wide demographic of students through indigenous storytelling. The programm does outreach and workshops at schools around Canada and has succeeded in constructing a network of math and indigenous language educators around the counrty.\n\nMy Involvement with Mathcatcher\n\n\nI am currently a research assistant for the Math department at SFU under Dr. Veselin Jungic. Veselin is effectively the father of the project and he is responsible for organizing pretty much everything. I am responsible for editing and directing the Mathcatcher videos. In particular, I have been working on the project since the beginning of this year and have produced all of the French, Spanish, a Gitxsan and a few Wet’suwet’en videos.\n\nVideo Editing\n\nI haven’t been posting as often as usual due to having to deal with ICBC and finding a new car which has occupied all my time. I have also been working on this exact project, so I decided that I would use it as a blog post and stone two birds at once. I employ Adobe Premiere to edit these videos and it has taken me a few years of hobby video-editing projects to get to this point. My editing involved layered masking in some circumstances to include translated titles while still preserving the original art of the video.\n\nThese skills can be applicable in the context of a high school classroom for example in the context of animations. In my own subject area of physics, kinematics and movemeent can be a tricky subject to teach. By demonstrating how to stop-motion animate objects moving around a screen or magazine cutouts moving around a page, students can visualize exactly what acceleration, velocity and displacement mean. To move an object you simply displace it to the desired location. To model velocity, you move the object one unit of distance every frame (or every camera exposure). For higher velocities, you can move the object larger units per frame. To model acceleration, you slowly increase or decrease the distance the object travels each frame.\n\nI wanted to include an example of this old-fasshioned animating style, but unfortunately I don’t have time or space to set up my lab. In the future I might be able to post a sample. I need to find a way to embed locally hosted videos on this website first since I don’t really want to upload any of my personal work to youtube or vimeo. I feel this work is relevant to the topics of graphic design and editing that we were talking about a few weeks ago. An example of one of the videos I have helped to reate is shown below.\n\n\n  \n\n\nAudio Editing\n\nAudio editing is also involved since some videos include soundscapes, some of which I record myself. For one video, I needed audio of a fish jumping out of the water. Since at the time I was living on Gambier island, I was able to go down to whispering creek the same day and record a salmon run which was happening at the time.\n\nThe most difficult audio to work with is dictation. Since most of the videos I am now dealing with are in Gitxsan and Wit’suwit’en, I have to piece together recordings of a language I barely understand. I have to say though after listening to many of these stories hundreds of times, I now have a short vocabulary in these languages.\n\nCross-Curricular\n\nI believe that this project is relevant to the PSII learning philosophies that the speaker outlined a couple weeks ago. In particular, that the Mathcatcher project is cross-curricular. The mathcatcher videos are a language revitalization program which really effectively veil math and logic problems. Each video contains a question at the end that students can take their time to think about. I has been motivated through storytelling, and in that way is also multi-modal. I believe that this project is proof that indigenous worldviews can be integrated into math education.\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis website is no longer in its infancy. This post outlines the process by which I created this blog.\n\nHomebrew\n\nI don’t really have much coding experience. Most of my data crunching was done in MATLAB in my undergrad. I had a course in Fortran, but those skills dont really translate to useful languages that are actually used today. The most useful thing i learned was navigating my computer using bash. Creating and deleting files, editing documents, and writing programs from the command line.UNIX based computers do this with a “terminal” program, Windows computers have DOS and whatever they call their command line. This is basically where my knowledge ended before this program. Anyone who is looking at this post for advice, look elsewhere; I basically just banged my head against it for a couple months.1\n\nHomebrew is a free open-source package manager that operates from command line on UNIX-based operating systems. It was created in 2009. I used Homebrew to install jekyll and its dependancies as well as other useful software that I didnt know existed before this. Homebrew installs into /usr/local by default. Hit Cmd + Shift + . to see otherwise hidden folders in Finder. Dont delete any of them for no reason though, apple hid them for a reason. Running\n/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;\n\nin Terminal will install Homebrew. The Homebrew webiste contains analytics data, programs, changelogs etc. Homebrew was necessary for installing Jekyll which is the main compiler for the website. After all the programs necessary for jekyll were installed, I haven’t really used Homebrew much.\n\nJekyll2\n\nJekyll is a program that compiles websites. It is written in Ruby by Github founder Tom Preston-Werner. A host of volunteers maintains the software, and its most stable release was 4.2.0 in 2020. Detailed instructions for its installation are on their website. If you are running the latest operating systems of MacOS, I think it will probably work as advertised. For the rest of us stuck in late 2015, Jekyll only works with a particular version of Ruby installed (&amp;gt;2.5.0). Newer versions for whatever reason dont like being installed. I had issues with OpenSSH not being the right version. I don’t honestly remember what I did to get everything to install properly but forums are your friend. People with actual modern computers probably won’t have the issues I did since\n\n\n  “Jekyll requires Ruby v2.5.0 or higher. macOS Big Sur 11.x ships with Ruby 2.6.3. Check your Ruby version using ruby -v.”\n\n\nI mostly followed the instructions on the Jekyll website for the installation. Once set up, define a folder that you want to permanently be the website folder, then hit\n\n$ gem install bundler jekyll\n$ jekyll name-of-new-website\n$ cd name-of-new-website\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\nThe last line here hosts the website locally and updates every time you make a change to it. You can turn off your internet and work on it remotely. To view it in your browser go to localhost:4000.\n\nGithub\n\nNow there needs to be some way to host the website. Github pages does this for free as long as you can keep your website to under 1 gb. Github is also open-source software. I have no idea where they get money from but it doesn’t seem to be advertising. Get a Github account and then install git and any other dependancies you might need using Homebrew. What you need to do is clone a folder on your computer to a repository on Github. To get a nice URL for your website like github-username.github.io, create a repository of the same name. Go to the pages section of settings for that repo, and enable Github Pages.\n\n\n\n\nOk, now there needs to be an easy way of updating the repo straight from your computer where you edit it.

If permissions are set correctly for you to push straight onto the main branch of the repo then you can submit changes by hitting\n$ cd /where-you-want-site\n$ git add -A\n$ git commit -m &quot;desciption of any changes made&quot;\n$ git push\n\nWait 30 minutes, and Github will be hosting your website at https://github-username.github.io\n\nThe other thing I did to get a jump start on the blog is to populate my empty website with one of the templates listed on http://jekyllthemes.org/. I used Forever Jekyll as stated in the footer of this website, but this theme has its issues. I’ve definitely had to tailor it to my liking.

    "content"  : "\nThis post includes the first measurements of trees from Konuckson Park.\n\nThe Park\n\n\nWhere?\nKonuckson Park is located in the center of ten-mile point in Saanich, 10 minutes south of the university by bike. It is a walk away from Cadboro bay and is worth the hike because I believe it contains one of the largest Cottonwoods on the peninsula.\n\nWhen?\nI cant for the life of me find any historical documents about the park or its previous uses. Even the Saanich Parks website doesn’t have an article about Konuckson. I resort to Provincial GIS layers to try and infer what the history of the area is. It likely isn’t accurate, but all I’m trying to do is guess where the biggest trees are so. Yeah.\n\nWhat?\nThe image above is a city zoning map found on the Saanich archives. It depicts the city subdivisions as cut in the year 1948. The entirety of what is now Konuckson park lies over the block of lots between Phylis, Bedford, Tudor and Minnie. These roads’ names have since changed, but what doesn’t make sense to me is where these subdivisions went. There are something like 50 lots here which somehow have become a park. More digging using government layers on imapsBC reveals only about 10 of those original lots (the blocks south and north of the semi-circular lot 5) were turned into park. Since this was once private land, I did not expect to find anything old or big since settler landowners were privy to logging and clearing lots for agriculture.\n\n\nAs a curious tangent, I also found an interesting layer shaded light green below through imapsBC. The dark green areas are parks with the biggest one in the center being Konuckson. The light green patches overlap privately owned lots but are nevertheless marked “Registered and Recognized historic places”. The government data catalogue describes this layer as:\n\n\n  “The Historic Environment Spatial Layer contains polygons and related attributes representing post-1846 historic places in British Columbia that are recorded on the provincial heritage register. It does not include any archaeological site information.1”\n\n\n\n\nSome of them actually are archaological sites, but this isn’t the place to talk about that. Most of them are “historic residences”. Other than that, its seems what were “roads” through the park no longer exist. I guess houses were never built on the Konuckson blocks, and the land in some places may be mostly undisturbed.\n\n\nWho?\nJudging by the way the park has been zoned historically, I expect the land management of this area to have been dominated by settlers throughout the lifespans of any trees that now live there. I know in some places, indigenous groups maintain gardens and spiritual trails to this day. I don’t know if that would be the case here considering the circumstances, but I will tread lightly. It is in a very convenient location close to Cadboro bay, and its beyond question that the area was used extensively by groups here prior to settler arrival.\n\nSettlers may have modified the land by clearing, burning, or introducing new species, pests and diseases into the native ecosystem here. This wouldn’t really be conducive to saving large trees.\n\nWhy?\nTrees in parks generally aren’t cut down after they become parks. Its good reason to suspect that larger undisturbed areas might be found there. Also, the topographical shape of Konuckson is kind of like a bowl. It collects water, and the center of the park is quite wet; conducive to growing Cedar and Cottonwood. This is definitely an area to scout around.\n\nWhat we Found\n\nKonuckson has many trails covering the entire park. Its hard to get lost if you know which way you want to walk. Some of the trails look maintained by the city. Others look like they were made by deer or people infrequently walking by. I don’t know what the indigenous relationship with the area is, but my girlfriend pointed out Rattlesnake everywhere in one particular area. There was a large boulder, a semi-circle of smaller boulders, and some older Arbutus. Perfect place for a campfire.\n\nThe largest treee was easily the biggest Cottonwood I’ve ever seen right in the middle of the park where its the wettest. There are two Arbutus in one region that are about a meter across as well. The locations and measurements that we took are shown in the map below. Go check them out!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Theresa McFarland, “Historic Environment Spatial Layer”  2018-05-08 &amp;#8617;\n    \n  \n\n"

    "content"  : "Reflection on the role of technology in education.\n\nSocial Stigma and Technology in Classrooms\n\nFor the longest time, marijuana was a highly “controlled” substance in Canada. Simple posession of the plant could land you in jail with a criminal record. Despite this, millions of Canadians still took the risks of using the plant, cultivating it, and selling it. There are reasons for taking this risk. Marijuana has been shown to help treat chronic pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, nausea, and anorexia.1234 There is also research to suggest that weed can enhance creativity for some people.56\n\nThe question emerges, if the substance was so widely used, and had proven benefits in certain cases, why was the interaction with this plant so taboo? Does this stigma still exist after legalization?\n\nThroughout my time in high school, a war was waged against technology in the classroom. I have observed that instead of using technology to their advantage, many teachers, especially those taught industrial models of education, treat phones and computers like digital narcotics. The environment created for me and my peers in high school was not conducive to technological literacy. Instead, teachers would confiscate our property, even going so far as to break them in one case I experienced.\n\n\nThe archtype of “gamers” and other derivatives of tech culture carry the the social stigma regarding techonology; that it destroys creativity and makes you anti-social. Similarly, the ‘stoner’ archtype of the cannabis user propagates the artificial narrative that weed makes individuals lazy, less productive, or less creative. Neither of these stereotypes have any basis in truth.\n\nThis narrow-mindedness towards the opportunities that techology presents is similar to Canadas war on weed. Instead of researching the potential of the plant, it was outlawed. \nThe time has come to embrace technology in the classroom. Most students own smartphones and computers. Most of them carry their techonology on their person.\n\nTo prohibit something only creates uneeded division in any group. To prohibit a behaviour, such as the use of technology, divides a class into those who use phones and those who dont. A result of any division is alienation; being an outsider to a group.7 As Henri Tajfel theorized in his social identity theory, simple divisions into in-groups and out-groups are the basis of prejudice.8 Since this necessarily occurs when a teacher restricts the use of technology, some consequences could be that:\n\n\n\n  Alientated students refuse to participate in class.\n  Students are restricted from mode of communication they could effectively use to demonstrate understanding.\n  Students fight with the teacher.\n  Students fight amongst each other.\n\n\nBenefits of technology in the Classroom\n\nSo, why then should we decriminalize technology in the classroom? As the EDCI 336 speaker said this week, students are going to use their phones in class regardless of what you do. Why not use them to your advantage as a teacher? Furthermore, technology influences every aspect of life now from job seeking to picking up your groceries. To not teach students the benefits an pitfalls of technology would be doing them a disservice.\n\nIn the digital age, some people just use technology as their primary mode of communication. This fact should not be construed as a disorder but rather a utilization of available tools. The progress of research as a species has produced a new set of tools that our parents never had, and hence, a generational gap. This occurred with the advent of the printing press, again with telephones, automobiles etc., Vsauce has a good video discussing how technology creates generational gaps.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nTech literacy is real, and teachers need to account for students who use technology as a means of communicating. Many apps and programs can help complex learners demonstrate their understanding of a subject in a way that has never been possible before.\n\nAs platforms, many social media outlets facilitate a level personal expression that students might be uncomfortable exercising in person. Showcasing art, projects, and other work can be done in an ethically responsible way through the internet. These platforms also have the power to connect otherwise disparate groups of people which can have both positive and negative consequences, but for the sake of this argument, it can help facilitate discussions between students which otherwise might not have happened.\n\nThe internet is also the largest source of information humans have ever had immediate access to. Although this fact, and the way it is employed is also a double-edged sword, the efficiency with which students can now learn basic concepts through the use of the internet is reall a force to be harnessed. Take for example math. Many practice problems for any high school unit are available and are a google search away. Step-by-step instructions are available to help those who need the extra hand. Although this would seem to render the role of a teacher useless, it takes one to teach students how to use these tools.\n\nPitfalls of Technology in the Classroom\n\nTo extend the analogy made at the beginning of this post slightly further, just like weed, technology can be addicting.9 As a result, like anything addictive, excess use can be detrimental leading even to dependancy. I have spent this time arguing that technology has its place in classrooms, but I don’t believe that its role should extend beyond that of a tool.\n\nOveruse of technology can restrict learning in many ways. The most obvious way is that students might not pay attention in class. Although there can be many reasons why a student might refuse to pay attention to a teacher, texting a friend or playing a game are definitely two of them. Generally, I don’t think teachers are entitled to the attention of their students. I think teachers need to convince their audience that what they say has both meaning and relevance. Failure to capture the attention of students could be a result of a generational gap, or simply a breakdown in communication, but if the majority of students are playing on their phones during class, it probably means the material being taught doesn’t resonate with them in a meaningful way. Its the job of the teacher to fix this problem rather than condemn a symptom of it.\n\nAddiction to technology can complicate its role as a tool. Earlier the value of social media was pointed out. The pitfalls of social media, especially in the event of an addiction should now be summarized. The concept of an echo chamber emerges by segregating communities based on political, social or any other preferences. As stated before, social identity theory suggests that divisions between individuals necessitates prejudice. In this sense, many social media platforms have actually become the roots for racism and a host of other social problems, despite simultaneously uniting social justice groups. Social media platforms also open another platform for bullying.\n\n\nTechnology, if used incorrectly can miseducate students. A whole host of falsities exist on the internet, some of which are maliciouly and intentionally propagated to the student audience. This is why teaching tech literacy necessarily means teaching critical thinking. The ancient episdemological question; “what do we know, and how do we know it?” is very relevant here. To use the internet efficiently, students need to be taught\n\n  how to process data and information,\n  how to effectively search for what they are looking for,\n  how to spot misinformation,\n  how to weigh conflicting sources,\n  how to identify their own ways of knowing\n  how to take what they have learned and construct their own balanced opinion.\n\n\nNone of these critical aspects of tech literacy can be learned overnight, but this fact reinforces the reasons why we need to bring technology into the classroom.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Aggarwal SK, Blinderman CD.

    "content"  : "Reflection on the use of open-source educational material online.\n\nFavourite Open Sources of Information\n\nMy immediate reflections about this week center around my two favourite open sources of educational material - Wikipedia and the Creative Commons. Both have pros and cons, but I will be using both in my own future work.\n\nWikipedia\n\nWikipedia; the free encyclopedia has a bad reputation for not being accurate. Although its true in some cases, all sources of information, including peer-reviewed journals are subject to inaccuracies once in a while. I believe the strength of wikipedia is its ability to compile useful information. In published articles that have been reviewed, most claims are cited, providing a long list of shortcuts to potentially very reputable sources. Wikipdeia is also powered by the Creative Commons, and the many forms of information embedded in articles (images, gifs, videos) compliment the acticles themselves.\n\nCreative Commons\n\nThe Creative Commons is a hub for open-access media. It is a public databas of content free from many copyright legislation. This database is useful in education because it can be embedded and cited freely when building your own resources. Many works can also be manipulated and adjusted and republished. I hope to eventually register some of the work on this blog in the Creative Commons.\n"

    "content"  : "\nA rough summary of project procedure and preliminary knowledge about local trees.\n\nTree Search Details\n\nThe word “discovery” has been applied to many advancements by settlers in BC through history. To be clear, this is a personal project intended to collect and compile resources regarding interesting trees on the Saanich peninsula. I’ve only lived in this region for a few months, and I believe this project is a good excuse to learn about the region.\n\nBefore a comprehensive search for cool trees around Victoria begins, I have to specify some details about the search.\n\n\n  What is the relevance of this project?\n  How do we define a “big”, “old”, “gnarly” or otherwise “interesting” tree?\n  What measurements should be performed on trees found?\n  Which areas will be searched?\n\n\nWhat is the Point?\n\nThrough this project, I hope to develop a catalogue of “big”, “old”, “gnarly” or otherwise “interesting” trees. This catalogue will contain:\n\n\n  Exact tree locations (Lat., Long.)\n  Identify each tree’ species\n  Reference to species-specific entry in “Trees of BC” section of this blog\n  Average dimensions (circumference, height)\n  Pictures\n\n\nHonestly, this officially does nothing more than satisfy a personal curiosity, since all of this information has already been compiled by the municipalities of the region, even if it is not public.\n\nWhich trees should be included in Search?\n\nWalking down the street or through a park, there are trees everywhere. In order to make this project more concrete, I need operational definitions of “big”, “old”, or “gnarly”. Any combination of these adjectives constitues an “interesting” tree.\n\nTrees of BC\n\nFirstly, I want to restrict this project mostly to trees native to BC. This excludes many large trees in residential areas despite their size, but simplifies the project dramatically. I have included a list and summaries of the species I will be investigating under the tab “Trees of BC”. I hope to eventually compile a well-rounded list of resources to populate the entry for each species in that section. I will start by quoting the popular “Plants of Coastal British Columbia”1\n\nBy species, this project will investigate:\n\n\n  Western Hemlock\n  Grand Fir\n  Douglas Fir\n  Sitka Spruce\n  Pines (Lodgepole, Ponderosa, Jeffrey, Monterey)\n  Pacific Yew\n  Red Cedar\n  Yellow Cedar\n  Red Alder\n  Bigleaf Maple\n  Black Cottonwood\n  Giant Sequoia\n  Redwood Sequoia\n  Arbutus\n  Garry Oak\n  Dogwood\n\n\n“Big” Trees\n\nA big tree will be visually distinct with respect to other trees either in height or width. For conifers, I will set the “width” threshold for consideration in my index to be “easily more than my wingspan in diameter” which is approximately 175 cm. If a tree is found that roughly meets this criteria, its circumference will be measured by tape. For simplicity, I will just add every tree that I go to the trouble of measuring. To measure height, a sextant will be used. This is a device that measures angle. By measuring the angle between the horizontal and the top of the tree and recording some distances, you can roughly determine the tree height.\n\nIts harder to set a standard working definition of “big” for deciduous trees. I’m mostly going to focus on conifers anyway, but will visit most of the municipally recorded “significant” trees close to my location.\n\n“Old” Trees\n\nAn Old tree is defined as a tree that germinated before settlers would have logged an area. Note that traditional land management could account for the clearing of land. For the sake of this project, I’ll set the “old” threshold to be 250 years old - the way old growth is defined by the government. It is hard to determine the age of a tree. You need an increment bore to do it accurately. Some day I mmight buy one, but for the sake of this project, I will infer tree age from their diameter and the growth rates of trees of the same species. A felled tree can be measured for their average growth rate. I will therefore have to keep eyes out for dead trees with discernable ring structures to get a good estimate of the average growth rates for species in an area.\n\n“Gnarly” Trees\n\nA Gnarly tree is one that looks lit like these californian Bristlecone Pines.\n\n\n\nWhere are the trees?\n\nTo be clear, very comprehensive lists of “significant” trees have already been compiled in the municipalities of Victoria and Saanich. Since these are the regions closest to me, it is here that I will search for cool trees. For the sake of completeness, I will compile these municipal resources here. Through Saanich’s significant tree program, we have a valuable list of Schedule “B” to tree preservation bylaw, 2014 No. 9272. This list gives accurate directions to these trees as well as descriptions, and rough dimensions. They do not incrude their exact Lat. and Long. coordinates or accurate measurements. It is a rough list of some 150 trees of significance in the Saanich area. This resource is a valuable starting point for this project.\n\n\nThe Victoria municipality takes this one step further providing an entire LIDAR profile of the city’ tree canopy. An example is shown to the right. Vast data sets regarding the trees within this district are hosted through VicMap.2 When I get to looking at the Victoria district, I will try to use this LIDAR data. I should be able to search by specific height to find trees higher than a given threshold. This may be more trouble than it is worth.\n\n\nThe Highlands municipality has their Green Map also detailing rough locations of interesting flora. I don’t know if I will be able to travel over there however.\n\nThe BC big tree registry lists the largest known trees in BC. A couple of which are on the Saanich peninsula. This list will be consulted when exploring outside of the GVA. A snapshot of the list is shown here. Other than these resources, I hope to consult with traditional knowledge holders and experts, the raw LIDAR data, and directed hiking to find other trees to add to this list.\n\nSummary of Significant Trees\n\nThis table is a summary of the known trees than I’d like to visit. It is compiled from open datasets provided from local municipalities as well as the UBC big tree registry. I know for fact that this list is not exhaustive and have personally found trees not mentioned on this list of comparable and in some cases larger size.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Species\n      Location\n      Diameter (cm)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3501 Cedar Hill Rd.\n      99\n    \n    \n      Pacific Yew\n      6105 Castlrock Rd.\n      104\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1604 Derby Rd.\n      125\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      505 Dumeresq St.\n      98\n    \n    \n      Grand Fir\n      4389 Emily Carr Dr.\n      100\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1951 Ernest Av.\n      130\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      1815 Ferndale Rd.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Sequoia\n      4020 Gordon Head Rd.\n      135\n    \n    \n      Sequoia\n      4024 Gordon Head Rd.\n      156\n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      3875 Haro Rd.\n      132\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3114 Harriet Rd.\n      100\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1261 Hastings St.\n      120\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      3878 Hobbs St.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      3878 Hobbs St.\n      100\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      1029 Holmes St.\n      98\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1721 Jefferson St.\n      127\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4012 Malton Av.\n      123\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1721 Midgard Av.\n      115\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3830 Nancy Hanks St.\n      114\n    \n    \n      Monterey Pine\n      3941 Oakdale Pl.\n      60\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      5271 Old West Saanich Rd.\n      201\n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      6117 Old West Saanich Rd.\n      106\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      2661 Queenswood Dr.\n      113\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      756 Rogers Av.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Jeffrey Pine\n      3700 St. Aidan’s Street\n      90\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      759 Sanctuary Ct.\n      126\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1383 Scoular Pl.\n      111\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4033 South Valley Dr.\n      156\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4546 Viewmont Av.\n      114\n    \n    \n      Red Cedar\n      4635 West Saanich Rd.\n      250\n    \n    \n      Sequoia\n      4362 Wilkinson Rd.\n      200\n    \n    \n      Cottonwood\n      4450 Wilkinson Rd.\n      134\n    \n    \n      Redwood\n      2495 Arbutus Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      2879 Austin Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      1779 Barrie Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3005 Baynes Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      877 Beckwith Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4208 Belvedere Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Bruce Hutchison Park\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Cedar Hill X and Richmond Rds.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4081 Cedar Hill X Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Cedar Hill Golf Course\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1941 Cochrane St\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      1660 Feltham Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Bigleaf Maple\n      1931 Ferndale Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      South of 4196 Glanford Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Jeffrey Pine\n      Gordon Head and Ferndale Rds.\n       \n    \n    \n      Bigleaf Maple\n      3870 Hobbs St.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      4033-47 Hopesmore Pl.\n       \n    \n    \n      Grand Fir\n      Knockan Hill Park\n       \n    \n    \n      Bigleaf Maples\n      Maynard St. and Cadboro Bay Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Grand Fir\n      3039 McAnally St.\n       \n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      5760 Oldfield Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      5266 Old West Saanich Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      6130 Old West Saanich Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Lodgepole Pine\n      Rithets Bog\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      780 Rogers Av.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      3666 Saanich Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      Swan Lake Christmas Hill Sanct.\n       \n    \n    \n      Cottonwood\n      Swan Lake Christmas Hill Sanct.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      Torquay Dr. Ash Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      Tyndall Av. and El Sereno Dr.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oaks\n      1971-1979 Watson St.\n       \n    \n    \n      Sequoias\n      4347 Wilkinson Rd.\n       \n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      48.411448, -123.32035\n      174\n    \n    \n      Garry Oak\n      48.43766, -123.32986\n      150\n    \n    \n      Arbutus\n      48.50077, -123.34089\n      129\n    \n    \n      Shore Pine\n      48.43108, -123.41766\n      103\n    \n    \n      Douglas Fir\n      48.51640, -123.40335\n      223\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      MacKinnon, A., et al.

    "content"  : "\nAn outline of the PSII inquiry steps applied in a walk through a local park.\n\nThe PSII Inquiry Steps\n\nThe Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry has determined steps for competency assessment. These steps are presented graphically below.\n\n\n  \n    Starting: Learner creates/co-creates a question or questions that are of a kind that will allow an inquiry or a quest to take place.\n  \n  \n    Deepening: Learner takes on early research based on starting questions. May discuss with teacher and/or other learners to help flesh out ideas. Research may involve creating something or doing something besides just reading or talking. The goal is to improve the quality of the question(s) from Step 1.\n  \n  \n    Refining: Learner creates new questions based on research and learning in Step 2. These could be expressed in a mind map (to show how learner got there), or just a new list of questions.\n  \n  \n    Planning: Learner develops and plans learning activities, projects, sessions, experiences, etc. to address/explore new questions from Step 3, including timelines, assessment ideas, and resource needs.\n  \n  \n    Learning: Learner follows plans from Step 4, making modifications as needed. Daily and weekly work plans will reflect short-term goals. Assessment of learning will take place throughout this step. Reflection on learning is also part of this step.\n  \n\n\nInquiry Steps Applied to Tree Project\n\n\n  \n    Starting: I begin with the questions: “What is the biggest tree in Konuckson park?”, and “How will I find it?”\n  \n  \n    Deepening: I can increase my knowledge of Konuckson Park by contacting knowledge holders or finding resources regarding the history of the park. I can learn about the trees from literature. I can use GIS to hint at probable locations of trees.\n  \n  \n    Refining: After some research, I now wonder: “What is the history of Konuckson Park?”, “Was the area ever cleared or human-managed?”, “How would this affect the history of the trees?”, “Where is the most probable location of a large tree?”\n  \n  \n    Planning: I then commit to physically exploring the partsof Konuckson park which I think would be the most likely to have large trees. Since it was a wet area, I suspect to be looking for large Cottonwoods or Cedars. The timeline and notes are recorded in this blog.\n  \n  \n    Learning: After extensive searching, large trees were found. I now wonder if my research and explorations were exhaustive enough to merit moving on to a new area. I decide, my search was indeed exhaustive and continue to researching a new area (Phyllis Park). I can take what I learned from this cycle of the inquiry steps forward into future planning.\n  \n\n"

    "content"  : "\nThis post is an outline of the free-inquiry project I will complete for EDCI 336.\n\nTrees of Victoria\n\nI have decided to dedicate my free inquiry project to recording the size and locations of all the large or otherwise notable trees in the greater Victoria area (GVA). With help from the UBC Big Tree registry, GPS and GIS software, LIDAR (mapping technology), some basic measurement equipment, a camera and extensive hiking, I hope to reveal interesting dendrological specimens that grow around the Saanich peninsula. I also hope to write a website to help document my progress.\n\n\nI love discovering weird trees, especially those in urban places. I have wanted to start this project for some time but have lacked a medium through which I could record and document my procedure and findings. I believe this assignment for EDCI 336 is the perfect excuse to get moving. This blog will provide the perfect platform to summarize my notes and procedure for exhaustively searching the entire GVA for “cool” trees. It is also ideal for combining and presenting mixed media. As such, my notes, photos, maps and graphs can all be presented in a single post to best reflect an adventure or finding from a given day. The blog format is linear and simple which also serves as a useful educational tool.\n\nMotivation\n\nCrazy trees can be found where you would least expect them. My friend Jaden and I once found a Douglas Fir 2m in diameter (which is bigger than it sounds) right in our neighbourhood of Queens park. We had grown up our entire lives around this tree and always known of its presence, but we had never stopped and dedicated the entirety of our though to admiring the existence of this tree.\n\n\nI’ve never taken a biology course in my life, but as I spend more time around trees and allow their presence to just occupy my mind, the more my respect for the field deepens. Trees are amazing. Take it from me - a physicist who used to think that anything termed “organism” could be modelled by a spherical body of water in a vaccuum. We cannot live without them, and neither can the rest of our planet. As my appreciation for trees has grown, I have picked up on their language - small details I would never have noticed before. They make different sounds, smells and colours in different conditions, even within the same species. Fairly novel research by my hero Susanne Simard at UBC confirms that in many ways, trees do communicate. Forester Peter Wohlleben characterizes this research best in Hidden Life of Trees.1 Notably in our remaining old growth forests here in BC,\n\n\n  “the root systems of neighbouring trees inevitably intersect and grow into one another [and] usually there are fungi present that act as intermediaries to guarantee quick dissemination of … news. These fungi operate like fiber optic cables … fungal connections transmit signals from one tree to the next, helping trees exchange news about insects, drought, and other dangers. Science has adopted a term first coined by the journal NATURE2 for Dr. Simard’s discovery of the ‘wood wide web’ pervading our forests”(10)\n\n\nProject Outline\n\nIn essence, I want to systematically explore the entire GVA for interesting, gnarly, old or big trees on my mind. Obviously, it would help to have a guide of where to look for cool trees in order to expediate the search. Here I identify 3 main sources that might hint to where I will find them. This assignment is intended to focus on learning new skills; specifically those relating to tech literacy and education. I have chosen these three information systems specifically because I am not knowledgable in their use.\n\n\n\nConsultation with Experts and Indigenous knowledge Holders\n\nObviously, in a search to find interesting trees it would help to get in touch with those who study interesting trees, or else people who have lived around such trees since time immemorial. Although this consultation does not rely heavily on tech literacy outside email and other electronic communications, I believe that what I learn can be presented over a technological platform such as this blog. This blog allows for many modalities of knowledge to be presented. I will therefore summarize my learning with experts through my blog posts.\n\nPhysical Exploration\n\nTo find interesting trees, it will be crucial to physically search for them. Technology can be used to organize and expediate this process to avoid repeatedly searching particular places. It can be tricky to navigate the large forested parks in Victoria, so I will use the mapping features of either my phone or a dedicated GPS device to track my progress. My physical progress of sweeping the city will be summarized graphically on this blog.\n\nGlobal Information Systems (GIS) and Other Software\n\nI recently came across public light detection and ranging (LIDAR)3 data for Stanley park4 as collected by the Vancouver Parks board. The authors of the Vancouver Big Tree Hiking Guide then inspired me to consider using LIDAR to search for interesting trees. LIDAR paints a picture of the topography of a forest. It paints a 3D profile of a birds-eye-view. By subtracting out public data about the altitude of the ground, you can produce heatmaps that reveal where the tallest trees in a forest are located. An example of this is shown below.\n\n\n\nI am entirely unfamiliar with the software used to produce this plot, but its usefulness in this project cannot be understated. I have therefore decided to use this assignment as an excuse to learn ArcGIS; the software responsible for processing LIDAR data. Hopefully I will be able to create dendrological treasure maps pointing to the tall trees of Victoria. ArcGIS is installed on one computer for public use in the UVic library.\n\nWebsite\n\nI will be continuing to improve my coding in conjunction with this project in order to document my progress. I will therefore compliment my progress with the tree project with the progress I make on my website and label blog posts related to both as “Inquiry”\n\nFree-Inquiry Project Criteria\n\nSince trees and the sciences that describe them frequently occupy my mind, I believe this project adequately fits the criteria for this assignment; “a project to learn about something you are passionate or curious about.” Since “the purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use technology throughout the learning process, from finding resources and people, to documenting, curating, and reflecting on your learning”, through the use of this blog, open-source GIS software and LIDAR data, MATLAB, the creative commons and other online materials, I will demonstrate this learning outcome.\n\nISTE Student Learning Outcomes\n\nThis assignment is set to address points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the ISTE learning outcomes. I have them listed here for my own reflection to refer back to when writing posts and updates to this project.\n\n\n  \n    Empowered Learner: Students leverage technology to take an active role in choosing, achieving, and demonstrating competency in their learning goals, informed by the learning sciences.\n  \n  \n    Digital Citizen: Students recognize the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of living, learning and working in an interconnected digital world, and they act and model in ways that are safe, legal and ethical.\n  \n  \n    Knowledge Constructor: Students critically curate a variety of resources using digital tools to construct knowledge, produce creative artifacts and make meaningful learning experiences for themselves and others.\n  \n  \n    Innovative Designer: Students use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new, useful or imaginative solutions.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Wohlleben, Peter, et al.

    "content"  : "\nThis is my first official post on this blog. I have created it as part of the EDCI 336 class at UVic.\n\nHello World\n\nI have constructed this website from a template I found on Github using Jekyll. I don’t take credit for writing a lot of the skeleton of the website, but I’ll credit the actual authors and software developpers in the footers once I finish the skeleton.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI love trees, photography, physics and education. I believe this blog will be a good place to share these interests as well as complete the objectives for my EDCI 336 class.\n\nI have opted to not use Wordpress as the platform for this project because I dont know how they handle data. I also don’t want to have to pay for my website. I hopefully will be able to use this site to host my CV, research, and cool projects in the future, so I wanted to really put the time into making something that I can own and completely control for the rest of my life.\n\nI will be sharing quite a bit of my photography. I put a lot of thought into my pictures, and they’re a good demonstration of how art and science are two sides of the same coin.\n\nMost of my photos relate to the natural world. Growing up in British Columbia, its difficult not to be connected to our enormous forests. I’m also really interested in climate science and modelling. Hopefully this will be a platform where I can share some ameteur studies that I’ve been planning to do for a few years.\n\nAnyway, I’ll beat out the last few bugs on this website and hopefully it’ll be all smooth sailing from there.\n"
